       "     'The Biden administration’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, introduced the $7,500 EV tax credit for consumer vehicles and numerous others for commercial EVs and battery production, among other things.',\n",
       "     'Since the law’s inception in 2022, EV sales have taken off. In 2023, the first full year of the credit, EV sales jumped 46% year over year to 1.19 million, compared to 813,000 in 2022, according to Cox’s Kelly Blue Book.',\n",
       "     'Last month in a new report dubbed “The Effects of ‘Buy American’: Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act, researchers Joseph Shapiro, Hunt Allcott, and Felix Tintelnot quantified the tax credit effect.',\n",
       "     'After constructing a model and running a simulation, the report found that EV sales in the US would drop 27% if the federal EV tax credit were removed, compared to a scenario with the EV tax credit in place. The report found this would lead to EV registrations falling to 867,000 EVs from 1.184 million with the tax credit in place — or 317,000 fewer EVs.',\n",
       "     'Bloomberg News was first to highlight the results of this report.',\n",
       "     '“This specific scenario is take summer of 2023, take all the conditions — supply, demand, and take away the EV tax credits — how would sales fall?” Joseph Shapiro, UC Berkeley associate professor of economics and co-author of the report, told Yahoo Finance.',\n",
       "     'With EV sales growing nearly 40% year over year last year, losing the EV tax credit is a \"substantial change,\" Shapiro said. \"It\\'s a rapidly growing market and relatively new technology, but [loss of the EV tax credit] is not trivial. I mean, $7,500 is not trivial,” Shapiro added.',\n",
       "     'But there are caveats here. Shapiro notes that while a 27% decrease is substantial, relative to what sales would be otherwise, it may not be that big of a deal. EV sales increased over 40% year on year in 2023, meaning sales could be at a “flatline” if the tax credit were repealed.',\n",
       "     'That being said, sales for this year are only trending up 10% year over year through Q3, according to Kelley Blue Book, indicating a significant impact, assuming sales trend at the same level in Q4.',\n",
       "     'While repealing the tax credit would be damaging to near-term EV sales, there are possible ways to refine its effects for the better. Shapiro and his co-authors also noted that the federal EV tax credit as constructed is not very efficient.',\n",
       "     \"One alternative: different subsidies for different vehicles. Certain bigger EVs create “large negative externalities” — meaning they're more likely to have fatal accidents in addition to high energy use. Smaller EVs get the same tax credit benefit despite being lightweight, better for safety, and demanding much less electricity.\",\n",
       "     \"“We're giving the same $7,500 subsidy to most of those vehicles, and giving smaller subsidies to cars that have larger costs to society, larger externalities, that would make these subsidies more beneficial to society overall,” Shapiro said.\",\n",
       "     \"Tweaks, if any, will be down the road, and that path is uncertain, given Trump's team is still in the process of being formed. For now, EV makers will probably have to deal with some potential bad news, with research showing over 300,000 fewer EVs sold with tax credit repeal.\",\n",
       "     'Wall Street predicts automakers will have to find ways to pick up the slack somewhere — perhaps cutting into profits with deeper discounts.',\n",
       "     '“All else equal, a removal of incentives would make EVs significantly more expensive, adding downward pressure to out-year volumes, assuming [original equipment manufacturers] do not compensate with incremental discounting,” Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas wrote in a note earlier this week.',\n",

Despite being labeled an “outside of government” group by President-elect Donald Trump, the two say that DOGE will work closely with Congress and the executive branch.',\n",

       "     'In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal (NWSA), the duo said Wednesday that they would “serve as outside volunteers, not federal officials or employees,” a distinction intended to allow the businessmen to retain their financial interests. Musk is the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA), which have received billions of dollars in government contracts, and the executive has several other companies also regulated by federal agencies.',\n",
       "     'Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that they are working with the Trump transition team to hire a team of “small-government crusaders.” Last week, DOGE began accepting applications delivered through direct messages on the social media site X, seeking to hire individuals willing to work more than 80 hours per week.',\n",

House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer is expected to launch a subcommittee—chaired by controversial Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene—that will work with DOGE, Fox News reports.',\n",
       "     '“I’m excited to chair this new subcommittee designed to work hand in hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and the entire DOGE team,” Greene told Fox. “We will identify and investigate the waste, corruption and absolutely useless parts of our federal government.”',\n",
       "     'As for the source of those cuts, DOGE is eyeing headcount reductions, federal spending “being used in ways that Congress never intended,” and regulations deemed wasteful by the duo. In the opinion piece, the DOGE leaders named a few targets.',\n",
       "     'Musk and Ramaswamy said they would chop funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The group was founded by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 and has supported the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio, which Musk and other conservatives often criticize. The DOGE leaders also hope to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that provides reproductive and sexual health services. Much of the nonprofit’s funding comes from government reimbursements and grants.',\n",
       "     'DOGE will also work with legal experts at government agencies to apply recent rulings and hand Trump a list of regulations they would like him to freeze through executive order. The group will tackle how agencies order goods and services, writing that large-scale audits would “yield significant savings,” pointing to the Pentagon’s latest failed audit.',\n",
       "     'As for federal workers, Musk and Ramaswamy plan to work with government agencies to identify the minimum number of staffers needed for departments to “perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions.” They float recommending Trump issue incentives for early retirement or voluntary buyouts.',\n",
       "     '“Not only are fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations, but the agency would produce fewer regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited,” they wrote. “Employees whose positions are eliminated deserve to be treated with respect, and DOGE’s goal is to help support their transition into the private sector.”',\n",

The president-elect has pledged to dismantle the Department of Education, a long-standing conservative goal. That department employs 4,400 people, according to its website.',\n",

       "     'The Biden administration’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, introduced the $7,500 EV tax credit for consumer vehicles and numerous others for commercial EVs and battery production, among other things.',\n",
       "     'Since the law’s inception in 2022, EV sales have taken off. In 2023, the first full year of the credit, EV sales jumped 46% year over year to 1.19 million, compared to 813,000 in 2022, according to Cox’s Kelly Blue Book.',\n",
       "     'Last month in a new report dubbed “The Effects of ‘Buy American’: Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act, researchers Joseph Shapiro, Hunt Allcott, and Felix Tintelnot quantified the tax credit effect.',\n",
       "     'After constructing a model and running a simulation, the report found that EV sales in the US would drop 27% if the federal EV tax credit were removed, compared to a scenario with the EV tax credit in place. The report found this would lead to EV registrations falling to 867,000 EVs from 1.184 million with the tax credit in place — or 317,000 fewer EVs.',\n",
       "     'Bloomberg News was first to highlight the results of this report.',\n",
       "     '“This specific scenario is take summer of 2023, take all the conditions — supply, demand, and take away the EV tax credits — how would sales fall?” Joseph Shapiro, UC Berkeley associate professor of economics and co-author of the report, told Yahoo Finance.',\n",
       "     'With EV sales growing nearly 40% year over year last year, losing the EV tax credit is a \"substantial change,\" Shapiro said. \"It\\'s a rapidly growing market and relatively new technology, but [loss of the EV tax credit] is not trivial. I mean, $7,500 is not trivial,” Shapiro added.',\n",
       "     'But there are caveats here. Shapiro notes that while a 27% decrease is substantial, relative to what sales would be otherwise, it may not be that big of a deal. EV sales increased over 40% year on year in 2023, meaning sales could be at a “flatline” if the tax credit were repealed.',\n",
       "     'That being said, sales for this year are only trending up 10% year over year through Q3, according to Kelley Blue Book, indicating a significant impact, assuming sales trend at the same level in Q4.',\n",
       "     'While repealing the tax credit would be damaging to near-term EV sales, there are possible ways to refine its effects for the better. Shapiro and his co-authors also noted that the federal EV tax credit as constructed is not very efficient.',\n",
       "     \"One alternative: different subsidies for different vehicles. Certain bigger EVs create “large negative externalities” — meaning they're more likely to have fatal accidents in addition to high energy use. Smaller EVs get the same tax credit benefit despite being lightweight, better for safety, and demanding much less electricity.\",\n",
       "     \"“We're giving the same $7,500 subsidy to most of those vehicles, and giving smaller subsidies to cars that have larger costs to society, larger externalities, that would make these subsidies more beneficial to society overall,” Shapiro said.\",\n",
       "     \"Tweaks, if any, will be down the road, and that path is uncertain, given Trump's team is still in the process of being formed. For now, EV makers will probably have to deal with some potential bad news, with research showing over 300,000 fewer EVs sold with tax credit repeal.\",\n",

Per the CRL, the agency requested additional data from Novo Nordisk on the drug’s administration and manufacturing process. Last month, the EMA’s CHMP recommended approving Novo’s drug to treat patients aged 12 years or older living with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors.

       "     \"Is Merck's Keytruda empire crumbling? The company's famous cancer drug is by far its biggest growth driver and typically accounts for over 40% of its revenue. However, in September, Summit Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotech, reported that a medicine called ivonescimab performed better than Keytruda in a phase 3 study conducted in China on patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a PD-L1 protein overexpression.\",\n",
       "     \"NSCLC is Keytruda's most important market. This result, albeit from a Chinese study, suggests that the blockbuster medicine could soon face serious competition. Investors are rightly worried, but there is more to the story. First, ivonescimab just started late-stage studies in the U.S. It will take a couple of years (at least) before the medicine earns approval in the country, if it goes that far.\",\n",
       "     \"In the meantime, Keytruda should continue its march forward. Second, Merck's crown jewel was set to face a patent cliff by 2028 anyway. Even if ivonescimab is approved in the U.S. in two years, by the time it takes significant market share away from Keytruda, its patent exclusivity may have expired. True, Merck's goal is to develop a subcutaneous version of Keytruda that will earn many of the same indications and extend its patent life beyond 2028.\",\n",
       "     \"So, ivonescimab could still be a threat. Merck agrees. The company recently penned a licensing agreement with China-based LaNova Medicines for an investigational therapy called LM-299. Like ivonescimab, LM-299 is a bispecific antibody, a newer class of cancer drugs that could prove more effective than the older checkpoint inhibitors, the category to which Keytruda belongs. Merck's licensing agreement with LaNova shows it isn't resting on its laurels. It will seek to remain a force in oncology.\",\n",
       "     \"Elsewhere, Merck continues to deliver decent financial results and earn brand-new approvals. In the third quarter, the company's revenue increased by 4% year over year to $16.7 billion. Earlier this year, it earned approval for Winrevair, a new therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Merck's pipeline features several dozen programs, and it has the means to acquire smaller drugmakers or sign licensing agreements with them, just as it did with LaNova Medicines.\",\n",
       "     'Merck is a solid dividend stock, too, with a forward yield of 3.2%. Its payouts have increased by 71% in the past decade. The stock might be 12% since 2024 started because of Keytruda-related issues, but it is still worth buying for long-term investors.',\n",
       "     'Pfizer has yet to win back investors. Once it stopped generating mouthwatering sales from its coronavirus franchise, its shares fell off a cliff and have hardly recovered since. However, Pfizer has made plenty of progress. It has earned several new approvals, including RSV vaccine Abrysvo, alopecia areata treatment Litfulo, and hemophilia therapy Hympavzi.',\n",
       "     \"Pfizer also remains a leader in what is left of the COVID-19 vaccine market. In the third quarter, Pfizer's revenue grew by 31% year over year to $17.7 billion. Even excluding the $854 million in sales generated by products from its November 2023 Seagen acquisition, Pfizer's revenue grew by about 25% compared to the year-ago period. Investors might feel as though Pfizer is still too dependent on its COVID-19 products -- they were the biggest reason for its Q3 performance, but they are somewhat seasonal items.\",\n",
       "     \"That's especially true of Pfizer's vaccine, Comirnaty. So, perhaps the drugmaker can't count on it to drive this kind of top-line growth every quarter. The good news is that Pfizer's innovative wheel keeps rolling. In oncology, the company plans to bring its number of blockbusters to more than eight by 2030 from the five it currently has in this therapeutic area. In weight loss, the hottest field in the industry, Pfizer is developing danuglipron. Pfizer's pipeline features 108 compounds across many studies.\",\n",
       "     'Even a handful of approvals or label expansions per year would allow the company to significantly upgrade its lineup and decrease its exposure to the coronavirus market.',\n",
       "     \"Lastly, Pfizer is also worth considering for its dividend program. The company's forward yield is a juicy 6.77%, while its payouts increased by 50% in the past 10 years. Pfizer is slowly but surely planning for the future. It might require patience, but the company could deliver rich returns to investors who buy its shares today and hold them for more than five years.\",\n",

Texas, Nov. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon, a global leader in driving virtualized and Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) technologies, has deployed Open RAN (O-RAN) based Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) systems with multiple vendor interoperability at The University of Texas Moody Center and the Austin Convention Center. These are the first DAS systems commercially deployed in the Verizon network using O-RAN interfaces between the various components of the cellular Radio Access Network from different vendors.',\n",
       "     'Both systems use a Samsung vDU with an O-RAN interface to a Commscope DAS, illustrating how ORAN standards can bring together best-in-class products from the ecosystem to create a highly efficient solution and provide Verizon’s high-performing 5G Ultra Wideband service throughout the venues. Not only does this commercial deployment mark a major step towards larger-scale, multi-vendor deployments using O-RAN, but it materially impacts the cost of power, space and cooling by eliminating unnecessary RF equipment, and improves reliability resulting in a gold-standard customer experience for fans and visitors to these venues.',\n",
       "     '“The massive evolution of our network over the past few years including our move to a cloud-based architecture, widespread virtualization and our aggressive adoption of O-RAN standards and capabilities has enabled us to show O-RAN interoperability success in a commercial environment,” said Adam Koeppe, Senior Vice President of Technology Planning at Verizon.',\n",
       "     'O-RAN offers the promise of a wide range of benefits that should introduce new competition and innovation into the RAN ecosystem with the establishment of open and interoperable interfaces between different hardware and software components. The transition to Open RAN has the potential to bring many benefits in terms of deployment flexibility, faster innovation in an open environment, and greater service options by increasing the opportunity for new entrants to provide competitive and advanced solutions.\\xa0More competition, more innovation, and increased supplier diversity will all be net benefits to operators and customers.',\n",

High-yielding stocks can be due for cuts to their payouts if a company's underlying financials aren't strong enough to support its dividend payments. But that doesn't mean all high-yielding stocks are dangerous investments.\",\n",
       "     \"Two good examples of stocks that pay more than 6% and can still be ideal long-term options for retirees are Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). Although their yields are high, these stocks are not as risky as they may appear to be. Here's why.\",\n",

       "     \"A bearish outlook for the future has resulted in Pfizer's stock price tumbling more than 10% this year, despite what has generally been a strong year for the markets. The top healthcare stock is trading around its 52-week low, and its yield is incredibly high at around 6.8%.\",\n",
       "     'Protecting that dividend is a priority for CEO Albert Bourla, who earlier this year referred to the payout as a \"sacred cow\" for the business, recognizing the importance it has for investors who rely on the recurring payment. Pfizer has been making dividend payments for 344 consecutive quarters, and it has been one of the most stable income stocks to own in the healthcare industry.',\n",
       "     'The company recently raised its guidance for 2024 in light of strong earnings numbers. However, investors remain worried about the future, including how it will deal with a new U.S. administration and the possible implications that changing regulations may have for its operations, and how it will grow as it faces multiple patent cliffs.',\n",
       "     \"The reason I'm not worried about Pfizer is that regardless of who is in office, there's going to be a need for constant and ongoing innovation in healthcare. Pfizer has been a top name in that regard for decades. Its acquisition of oncology company Seagen last year highlighted its aggressive growth strategy, as the move cost Pfizer $43 billion. It has also pursued smaller companies over the years in a bid to bolster its pipeline and strengthen its growth prospects.\",\n",
       "     'As for patent cliffs, they are something that every healthcare company with a top drug will have to worry about at some point. But by focusing on expanding and diversifying its operations, Pfizer is in excellent shape to overcome those challenges. Bourla previously said that by 2030, the company may add up to $25 billion in revenue from new drugs and acquisitions, which will help offset losses due to generics.',\n",
       "     \"The company's earnings numbers have been choppy due to write-downs and fluctuating COVID-19-related sales. But last quarter, Pfizer generated $6.1 billion in free cash flow, which is more than twice what it paid in dividends ($2.4 billion). While the company is undoubtedly facing some challenges, the business is in much better shape than bearish investors may give it credit for.\",\n",
       "     \"Retirees can get another mouthwatering yield from Verizon, which currently pays 6.5%. The telecommunications company has also been increasing its dividend for 18 straight years. The most recent increase came in September when the company boosted its dividend by 1.9%. While that's not a huge increase, it's still a testament to Verizon's commitment to growing the payout.\",\n",
       "     \"It also comes at a time when the business isn't growing all that fast. This year, the company anticipates a growth rate between 2% and 3.5% in its core wireless service business. But in the long run, there could be more room for Verizon to get bigger. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to acquire Frontier Communications, which will expand its fiber footprint to more markets. The $20 billion deal would be accretive to both Verizon's top and bottom lines as soon as it closes. Frontier shareholders approved the deal, and it's expected to close in early 2026.\",\n",
       "     \"Verizon is a top name in telecom, but the stock has been an underwhelming buy in recent years as rising interest rates have made investors bearish on capital-intensive businesses. As rates continue to come down and investors seek safety, it may only be a matter of time before shares of Verizon start to rally. While the stock isn't trading at its low for the year, it's still an incredibly cheap buy.

       "     \"NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s earnings report provides insight into the company’s growth trajectory, highlighting the aspects that matter and those that don’t. The company delivered $35 billion in revenue for the October quarter, meeting whisper numbers, and issued a January guidance of $37.5 billion, slightly below the whisper number of $38 billion. Gross margins dipped a bit too, but ultimately these numbers don't matter as much.\",\n",
       "     'The AI star lies in a boom or bust industry. Before the generative AI excitement, the company’s business declined 21% year-over-year. However, Nvidia’s market cap has skyrocketed since, driven by the extraordinary demand for its Blackwell GPUs.',\n",
       "     'The true pressure point for Nvidia lies in the commentary about Blackwell, Nvidia’s generative AI architecture. Looking at the key commentary from Nvidia’s CFO, we find that demand for Blackwell will continue to exceed supply for several quarters. There have also been some supply difficulties, albeit quite small.\\xa0 This narrative has evolved positively compared to the October earnings call, with supply constraints expected to ease slightly earlier—from “into 2025” to “mid-2025.”',\n",
       "     'Additionally, the earnings call mentions twice that the demand for Blackwell has grown even stronger over the past three months, setting up 2025 as a robust year. While this doesn’t provide complete visibility into 2026, it does base a strong foundation for continued momentum.',\n",
       "     \"Driving Nvidia’s growth is the principle of scaling laws. Scaling is what's effectively needed to make AI models smarter. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, likened this to Moore’s Law, where CPU speeds doubled every few years even though it was expected otherwise. The industry’s continuous innovation and adherence to scaling principles are bound to propel Nvidia’s AI computing demand, reinforcing the long-term outlook.\",\n",
       "     'Wall Street projects 20% year-over-year growth for calendar year 2026. Based on Nvidia’s trajectory, Deepwater anticipates this could accelerate to over 30% growth, stating that there is plenty of time for the business to appreciate.',\n",
       "     \"Our research director shared his views on NVDA's earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

       "     'TORONTO, Nov. 21, 2024 /CNW/ - Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) announced today that Health Canada has issued a Notice of Compliance (NOC) for CARVYKTI® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and who are refractory to lenalidomide.1\\xa0With this approval, CARVYKTI® becomes the first and only B-cell Maturation Antigen\\xa0(BCMA)-targeted therapy approved for the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma as early as second line.',\n",
       "     'CARVYKTI® previously received a Notice of Compliance with conditions (NOC/c) from Health Canada for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody, and who are refractory to their last treatment.1',\n",
       "     \"Canada's Drug Agency (CDA-AMC) has recently recommended CARVYKTI® for reimbursement with conditions for eligible patients who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. In its rationale for the recommendation, CDA-AMC pointed out that the CARTITUDE-4 trial demonstrated that treatment with CARVYKTI®, compared to standard of care, was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) in eligible patients. This builds on their prior recommendation for reimbursement with conditions for CARVYKTI® in 2023 in eligible patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, based on the results of the CARTITUDE-1 trial. Johnson & Johnson is actively working with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance to negotiate reimbursement for CARVYKTI® to enable public access.\",\n",
       "     '\"The new approval for CARVYKTI® fills an important gap for patients with multiple myeloma who may require this therapy as early as first relapse and represents a significant milestone for Canadian patients with this disease,\" says Dr. Donna Reece*, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Canadian Myeloma Research Group. \"The first approval for CARVYKTI® was for its use in treating patients with refractory myeloma who had received at least three prior lines of therapy that included the three main drug classes (proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies). However, myeloma treatment options have advanced rapidly, and Canadian patients with relapsed multiple myeloma may have received all these agents in second- or even first-line treatment, and yet have not qualified for CARVYKTI® — a highly effective immunotherapy that is transforming the treatment of multiple myeloma. This expanded indication will allow eligible patients with multiple myeloma to receive CARVYKTI® much earlier in their treatment journey.\"',\n",
       "     '\"The clinical trial showed that a single infusion of CARVYKTI® significantly lowered the risk of disease progression or death compared to current standard of care,\" says Dr. Richard LeBlanc**, Hematologist, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. \"This authorization means patients have a more effective treatment option that offers an opportunity for a deeper and durable response as early as their first relapse.\"',\n",
       "     'Multiple myeloma is the second most common form of blood cancer in Canada and it is estimated that 1,750 Canadians will die from the disease in 2024.2,3 While the introduction of novel therapies in recent years has led to significant improvements in PFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with multiple myeloma, the disease remains incurable, with nearly all patients relapsing and requiring subsequent therapy.4,5 As the disease progresses, patients experience cycles of relapse and remission, with periods of remission generally becoming progressively shorter with each new line of therapy.6,7',\n",
       "     '\"With the progressive, cyclical nature of multiple myeloma, the sooner we can give patients the treatment that is right for them, the higher the likelihood that more patients achieve better outcomes and an improved quality of life,\" says Martine Elias***, CEO, Myeloma Canada. \"This approval offers patients hope that their next treatment will help extend remission and give them more precious quality time with their loved ones.\"',\n",
       "     'This\\xa0latest Health Canada authorization\\xa0is based on results from the Phase 3\\xa0CARTITUDE-4 study, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI® versus standard of care regimens of either pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who received one to three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.1 A total of 419 patients were randomized to receive CARVYKTI®\\xa0(208 patients) or standard of care (211 patients).1\\xa0Of the patients in the standard of care arm, 183 received DPd and 28 received PVd.1 All the patients in the CARVYKTI®\\xa0arm underwent leukapheresis and received bridging therapy.1 At a median follow-up of 15.9 months, a 74 per cent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (PFS Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.26; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.18–0.38; p value p<0.0001) was observed in patients randomized to the CARVYKTI® arm compared to standard of care treatments.1',\n",
       "     'The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than 20 per cent) in CARTITUDE-4 were pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, hypotension, viral infection and nausea.1',\n",
       "     'The long-term results from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study shared by Johnson & Johnson at the 2024 International Myeloma Society (IMS) Annual Meeting (Abstract #OA-65) showed a single infusion of CARVYKTI®\\xa0significantly extended OS in patients with relapsed or lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug, reducing the risk of death by 45 per cent versus standard therapies of PVd or DPd. With these data, CARVYKTI® is now the first and only cell therapy to improve OS versus standard therapies for patients with lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma as early as second line.8',\n",
       "     '\"This milestone underscores our commitment to discovering and developing best-in-class therapies, particularly for incurable forms of cancer where patients face difficult prognoses,\" says Berkeley Vincent, President, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, Canada. \"CARVYKTI® plays an important role in our work to redefine multiple myeloma and ultimately help patients achieve sustained remission.

Further, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization to maintain superior performance as traffic increases. Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. It is reportedly the world’s largest supplier of LTE (Long-Term Evolution) technology with a significant market share and has established several LTE networks across the globe.\\xa0Ericsson is focusing on 5G system development and has undertaken many notable endeavors to position itself for market leadership on 5G. It currently has 170 live 5G networks across the globe, spanning 72 countries. The company believes that the standardization of 5G is the cornerstone for digitizing industries and broadband. The deployment of 5G networks is likely to boost the adoption of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, with technologies like network slicing gaining more prominence.\\xa0Ericsson continues to invest in the Enterprise business to make it a sizeable part of its business. The company has introduced on-demand network slicing capability in Android 14 devices. It empowers developers to enhance the flexibility of applications and allows service providers to better align network connectivity with user-specific requirements.',\n",
       "     \"Ericsson has inked a five-year contract worth $14 billion with AT&T Inc. T to modernize the latter’s network infrastructure. AT&T intends to leverage Ericsson technology to deploy a commercial-scale open radio access network (Open RAN) across the country to help build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers. For Ericsson, the deal marks a remarkable achievement in outdoing rivals by embracing Open RAN technology to help create an open, agile, programmable wireless network.Ericsson has stepped up production in its 5G Smart factory in Lewisville, TX, to cater to the increased demand for 5G equipment with an additional $50 million investment, bringing it to the forefront of 5G innovation. With highly automated and efficient processes, the factory is fully powered by renewable electricity, producing next-generation 5G and Advanced Antenna System radios for Ericsson's U.S. customers.\",\n",

Ericsson had warned that Sweden’s decision to exclude China-based vendors from Swedish 5G networks might adversely impact its business in the East Asian country. Disturbances in the supply chain are likely to further hamper its sales. It is also witnessing a revenue decline in the Middle East, Africa and India owing to lower capex spend from operators.',\n",

       "     '\"We are identifying ways to increase F100 engine sustainment work in Poland to ensure our Polish ally has the propulsion power they need,\"\\xa0said Piotr Owsicki, general director of Pratt & Whitney Rzeszów. \"We plan to use existing knowledge and experience, as well as infrastructure testing facilities, to provide the full cycle of F100 engine maintenance in country.\"',\n",
       "     \"Between 2005 and 2008, the original F100 engines powering the Polish Air Force's F-16 fleet were built by Polish employees at the Pratt & Whitney Rzeszów facility. Today, nearly 20 years later, the facility produces F100 static structures and critical rotating parts in support of new F100 engines and worldwide sustainment.\",\n",
       "     '\"Our cooperation with Pratt & Whitney Rzeszów dates back to when they produced the F100 engines for the Polish F-16 fleet,\" said Mr. Dariusz Sokólski, president of Military Aviation Works No. 2 S.A. \"Participation in subsequent projects is a development of WZL2\\'s competencies beyond the repair of F100 engine modules, which in the future will give more opportunities to support the Polish Air Force.\"',\n",
       "     \"Should the Polish Air Force select the F-15EX to enhance its defense capabilities, the F100 engine is the F-15EX's best propulsion solution. The Polish Air Force's existing familiarity with the F100, coupled with the Polish industry's long-standing F100 MRO capability, will provide the most cost effective and lowest risk path to sustaining the engines and maximizing fleet readiness for both the F-15EX and F-16.\",\n",

       "     'Trump’s spending policies are expected to inject significant momentum into the defense industry, starting first with key manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman. With a Trump victory, there will be a decidedly hawkish undertone to budget amounts for defense.',\n",
       "     'With the Middle East threatening to explode into a wider regional conflict, with enough external actors to turn this into a world war, and with the Russia-Ukraine war still going strong and expanding into venues as far away as Africa, national defense has become a mainstream issue that captures voter sentiment more than it did the last time around.',\n",
       "     'Lockheed Martin manufactures F-35 fighter aircraft, and it is already outperforming its peers and enjoying its share of the Pentagon’s recent $12-billion budget bonanza. In these times of geopolitical escalation, Lockheed is likely a buy under any president, but Trump could push it over the edge.',\n",
       "     '#2 Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF)',\n",
       "     'Antimony is the “most important metal you’ve never heard of”, as Forbes has perfectly described it. It’s the national defense kingmaker, and Military Metals Corp. is uniquely positioned to supply what could be the most significant metal of our time.',\n",
       "     'According to the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), antimony is a highly critical element for the defense industry. It’s necessary for armor-piercing ammunition, infrared sensors, bullets, precision optics, nuclear weapons, semiconductors, cables, and batteries.',\n",
       "     'Antimony prices exploded this year, rising well over 200% after Beijing slapped export restrictions on antimony, with the explicit intention of restricting global shipments to shore up China’s own natural security. This move has sent shockwaves through the tech and defense industries. Antimony is currently trading at over $35,000 a ton.',\n",
       "     'The few companies active in the space have seen their share prices jump. Larvotta Resources, an Australian miner saw its share price explode 800% as China moved to restrict antimony exports, while Perpetua Resources, a Pentagon-backed miner saw its share price jump by more than 200% since the beginning of this year.',\n",
       "     'Despite the major jump in antimony prices there are very few pure antimony plays in the market, but Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) stands out as a bold contender, aggressively building a portfolio of some of the most prolific, past-producing assets in Europe and North America. This ambitious explorer isn’t just gathering properties; it’s strategically seizing high-grade antimony and gold projects with historical impact such as the historical West Gore antimony mine, which was England’s largest supplier during World War I.',\n",
       "     'Across the ocean in Europe, the company recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia.',\n",
       "     'But the best thing here is the quality of the assets. Where development stage competitor Perpetua will mine antimony as a by-product at 0.06% per ton, the Slovakian properties of Military Metals Corp. easily reach up to 4% per ton of ore. According to Military Metals Corp. CEO Scott Eldridge, its assets are in the top three out of 15 companies globally in terms of quality of the assets.',\n",
       "     'Confirming its reputation as a fast-mover,\\xa0 Military Metals Corp. announced the acquisition of another 388 hectares\\xa0 at its Nova Scotia West Gore project and has now “gained complete coverage over the entire mineralized system including all the historical mine workings and known antimony-gold occurrences”.',\n",
       "     'Already earlier this month it made another acquisition, this time in Europe, where governments are just about as anxious about its future antimony supply as the United States.',\n",
       "     'On October 7, 2024, Military Metals Corp. pushed onward with its rapid advance on antimony assets with an agreement to scoop up 100% ownership in a private company that owns two antimony projects in Slovakia, including a third tin asset. The Trojarova Antimony Project, Tienesgrund Antimony Project and the Medvedi Tin Project all have Soviet-era resources.',\n",
       "     'The Trojarova project is one of the European’s Union’s largest historical Antimony resources.',\n",

We see this as a perfect alignment with the European Union\\'s Critical Raw Materials Act, opening the door to potential EU funding sources as we advance these projects toward production.\"',\n",
       "     'The company is rushing the antimony playing field here, moving at breakneck speed to acquire critical assets at the same time that China is tightening the reins on the rarest components of its national defense machine.',\n",
       "     'With wildly escalating geopolitical tensions, coupled with Western sanctions on Russian metals, what makes it a ‘Trump Trade’ is the added impact a renewed tariff war would have on American antimony supplies if China decides to fight back. Speculative demand is at an all-time high, even as China grapples with a downturn in demand since it implemented export restrictions.',\n",

Today, it’s trading in the low $700s, and American steel producers need a lifeline for slowing sales and faltering growth. Trump could be that lifeline, and Nucor looks nicely positioned to reap the benefits.',\n",
       "     'The American producer suffered this year, with revenue for the six months ended June 29 shedding 11% compared to the same period in 2023. Earnings per share have also taken a beating, down 40% from Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023. And Q3 earnings are expected to be worse, making this a good time to get in on the steel sector before it truly becomes a ‘Trump Trade’. There is a clear growth pathway here for Nucor, which is planning to invest $6.5 billion in eight major projects through 2027, but Trump policies would help bring the stock back up with the growth potential. A Trump promise of 10% tariffs on all important producers could reduce price competition pressure for Nucor, particularly emanating from producers based in China and Brazil.',\n",
       "     '\"While market conditions have softened compared to recent record-setting years, Nucor remains focused on its long-term growth strategy and has returned more than $1.7 billion to investors through June,\" Nucor CEO Leon Topalian said in a second-quarter earnings release.',\n",

       "     '“I think the reality is we are probably in one of the biggest periods of geopolitical uncertainty and instability we have seen in our lifetimes,” Brian Schimpf, co-founder and CEO of defense tech company Anduril Industries, said at the Yahoo Finance Invest conference.',\n",
       "     '\"For a Trump administration, the most important thing is to recognize the degree to which American leadership on this still really matters,\" Schimpf added, \"and a lot of that is going to come from the fact that we have the strongest and best military.\"',\n",

       "     '“Our view of this is let’s do what literally every free-market system has done,” he said. “Let’s just have the DOD be a better buyer. Buy the best tech. Show the entrepreneurs that if you build technology that actually works, that solves a real problem, we will actually buy it. And you have a chance to actually succeed doing that at scale.”',\n",
       "     'This view echoes a post made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk (TSLA), who has closely aligned himself with Trump in recent months, on social platform X. Musk responded to Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, saying it is “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” referencing the US Department of Defense and intelligence agencies.',\n",
       "     'Schimpf’s company is built to capitalize on a belief that the future of war will be defined by relatively low-cost autonomous systems and not by high-cost, low-quantity fighter planes and aircraft carriers. Anduril has built a portfolio of such products, including counter-drone aircraft, autonomous submarines, and an autonomous security tower deployed on US military bases.',\n",

       "     \"When you think about healthcare technology, you may imagine the pacemaker assisting your dad's ailing heart, the sutures your child received after a bike accident, or the pulse oximeter placed on your finger during your annual physical exam. You probably don't think about the energy or resources required to manufacture those products, nor the resulting emissions and waste.\",\n",
       "     'Most discussions about healthcare are, understandably and rightfully, centered on its ability to restore health and save lives; rarely do we talk about its environmental impact. Yet, the healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 4.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions-the equivalent of 514 coal-fired power plants annually, with medical devices and technology among the drivers. And in the U.S., healthcare is the second largest contributor to landfill waste.',\n",
       "     \"It's time to get real about the reality that human health is linked to the health of the planet. We can't be committed to one without also being committed to the other.\",\n",
       "     'The same force that revolutionizes patient care holds the key to creating a more sustainable industry: innovation. Both of us have seen how approaching innovation, with a deliberate focus on sustainability, is better for people, the planet, and profits. Consider the automotive industry where many innovations have made electric vehicles more enjoyable to own and drive, while also providing a cleaner transportation solution. And healthcare, where virtual visits that arose as a necessity during the pandemic, are showing a positive impact on the environment, while also making care more convenient and accessible.',\n",
       "     'So, how else can health tech make health better for you and the planet? Here are three not-so-simple ways:',\n",
       "     'Recognize good things take time',\n",
       "     'We know developing new healthcare technology requires patience and a substantial initial investment before we see long-term success. We need to apply this same mindset to sustainable technology.',\n",
       "     \"Some companies stick with existing solutions because new sustainable technologies are expensive or aren't ready for wide-scale adoption. That's why pilot projects are crucial stepping stones to broader implementation by giving sustainable technology the time it needs to mature and prove its effectiveness. Successful pilot projects often inspire a scalable roadmap for long-term cost efficiency.\",\n",
       "     \"At the same time, we need to balance short-term financial pressures with long-term environmental goals. That means adopting a future-oriented view, recognizing today's technology will only get better and become more accessible and affordable over time.\",\n",
       "     'For example, innovations in solar panels over the past decade have made them significantly more cost-effective as a sustainable energy source. This has allowed Medtronic to install 22 solar arrays across 16 locations, generating more than 35 MWs of power-enough to power more than 22,000 homes. And we recently signed a virtual power purchase agreement which adds renewable energy at a scale equivalent to nearly all our U.S. energy needs.',\n",
       "     'Companies that make these strategic investments today, with the same patience and investment they apply to product development, are setting themselves up for greater growth and profits down the line.',\n",
       "     'Reimagine products and packaging',\n",
       "     \"Sustainable product and packaging design are some of our industry's most complex challenges due to strict regulatory requirements that restrict circular design solutions.\",\n",
       "     \"Companies can begin reducing resource use and waste with takeback programs, recycling product components and transitioning to digital instructions for use. But the goal isn't just to reduce waste-it's to create products that maintain the highest standards of patient care while contributing to a circular economy.\",\n",
       "     \"To do that, we need to design products and packaging with their end-of-life journey in mind, whether that's reprocessing, recycling, or biodegradation. It's important to remember there are many ways to reach sustainability goals and although reprocessing is becoming more common practice, sometimes single use devices can be the right option, especially if reprocessing increases risk to patient safety.\",\n",
       "     \"It is the conscious actions at the beginning that count a lot-for example, designing for sustainability before the first prototype is even developed. Industry leaders are dedicating R&D teams to spot opportunities for circular solutions within products' lifecycles, like the Sustainability Development Center at Medtronic. (Learn more in our latest Impact Report.)\",\n",
       "     'Recruit partners',\n",
       "     \"No one can solve our industry's environmental challenges alone. It requires collaboration across the healthcare ecosystem.\",\n",
       "     \"This starts with our supply chains, given that Scope 3 emissions typically account for over 90% of a healthcare technology company's carbon footprint, including at Medtronic. Engaging suppliers, logistic partners, employees and customers will not only help address emissions, but it will also build resilience against future risks that threaten supply chain stability.\",\n",
       "     \"We also need to think beyond our own value chain and look to others in the industry, academia, civil society, and government to develop breakthrough solutions and new enabling policies and incentive frameworks. For example, the Dutch government's ESCH-R: Creating Circular Hospitals Together program is helping address critical circularity gaps in healthcare with sponsorship from industry partners (including Medtronic). Collaborative approaches like this are key to building the infrastructure, developing the technologies, and creating the standards needed for a collective impact.\",\n",
       "     \"The transformation to sustainable healthcare won't happen overnight, but momentum is building, and it will grow because it is good for business and good for the planet. Together, we can create a healthcare technology industry that heals not only people but also the planet we all share.\",\n",

       "     'Ken Griffin, the visionary founder of\\xa0Citadel Investment Group, launched his hedge fund in 1990 with $4.2 million, achieving unprecedented success. In 2022, Griffin’s fund delivered an extraordinary 153% return, driven by accurate bets on inflation and interest rates. With a portfolio now exceeding $518 billion, Citadel Investment Group is one of Wall Street’s most closely watched hedge funds, consistently achieving over 25% annual returns since 2016. Citadel employs a multi-strategy investment approach, combining long and short positions to capitalize on market opportunities.\\xa0Its flagship fund, Wellington, anchors Citadel’s operations by investing across multiple asset classes and sectors, emphasizing diversification. In 2022, Wellington achieved an impressive 38% return, building on 26% in 2021 and 24% in 2020. Notably, the fund posted a 19.4% gain in 2019, more than double its 9.1% return in 2018.',\n",
       "     'While Griffin’s legacy is strongly tied to Citadel’s hedge fund, a significant portion of his Forbes-calculated net worth comes from Citadel Securities, valued at $22 billion after Sequoia and Paradigm acquired a small stake two years ago. Citadel Securities has redefined modern trading, challenging the traditional dominance of big banks. In just two decades, it has become the largest stock buyer and seller in the U.S.; in August, it facilitated more equity trading within its electronic network than the New York Stock Exchange’s main market. In 2023, Citadel Securities generated $2.8 billion in profit from $6.3 billion in net revenue, with an impressive $4.9 billion in net revenue achieved in the first half of 2024 alone.',\n",

As the founder and CEO of Citadel, he contributed $100 million to conservative causes, making him the fifth-largest individual contributor to federal election spending, according to Federal Election Commission data. While Griffin has donated millions to Republican candidates, particularly since 2022, he has notably refrained from directly supporting Trump’s campaign. A self-described “Reagan Republican,” Griffin has historically favored establishment-focused Super PACs, such as the Congressional Leadership Fund.',\n",

       "     'The proposal, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and several states this week, came after a federal judge ruled that Google maintained an illegal monopoly over internet search.',\n",
       "     \"The landmark decision opened the door to the current showdown over potential remedies that could reshape the tech giant's multibillion-dollar business. As part of their proposed penalties, Justice Department officials also suggested the judge impose restrictions on Android, Google's mobile operating system, to prevent it from favoring Google products.\",\n",
       "     'The Department of Justice says forcing Google to divest Chrome would create more competition and stop the search giant\\'s control over a \"browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet.\" Google pushed back, calling the request an \"unprecedented government overreach\" that would harm consumers and U.S. tech leadership.',\n",
       "     '\"This is to some extent a negotiating dance,\" said George Hay, a Cornell University law professor and antitrust expert. \"The DOJ is probably trying to get Google to be more cooperative in coming up with remedies that will fix the problem.\"',\n",
       "     \"Here's what you need to know:\",\n",
       "     'What are U.S. officials proposing?',\n",
       "     'The Justice Department outlined for the judge several possible solutions in its 23-page court filing, including forcing Google to sell Chrome and potentially Android as well if the company does not adequately address its practice of requiring smartphone makers to use Google products embedded in Android.',\n",
       "     '\"The playing field is not level because of Google’s conduct, and Google’s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the filing says. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\"',\n",
       "     'The Justice Department wants to bar Google from entering into exclusive agreements with content publishers, as well as owning or acquiring any interests in search rivals. Publishers should also be able to opt out of having Google use their content to train artificial intelligence tools, under the proposal. And Justice Department officials want advertisers to have more access to data and control over ads that show up in Google search results.',\n",
       "     'The Justice Department is trying to make consumers more aware of choices outside of Google, the world\\'s most popular search engine. Another potential fix includes requiring Google to display a \"choice screen\" on every Google browser when a user hasn\\'t selected a default search engine.',\n",
       "     \"What's Google's response?\",\n",
       "     \"Google thinks the government's proposal goes too far. Instead, the company thinks the government should focus solutions more narrowly on agreements it has with Apple, Mozilla, smartphone manufacturers and wireless carriers that require the companies to favor Google's search engine over others.\",\n",
       "     'Kent Walker, chief legal officer at Google and its parent company, Alphabet, in a blog post called the government\\'s proposal a \"radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership.\"',\n",

       "     'Will this affect the way I search online?',\n",
       "     \"Because Google's punishment hasn't been decided, it is too early to say how internet search could be affected. Antitrust experts said it depends on what remedies the judge in the case decides on and whether they withstand scrutiny by an appeals court. Some experts questioned whether any changes, even a forced sale of Chrome, would be effective in getting people to use other search engines.\",\n",
       "     '\"It will still be there in some way, shape or form, but it may be more subtle in terms of the effects on consumers,\" said Shubha Ghosh, a law professor at Syracuse University.',\n",

       "     'In September, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled Google had illegally monopolized the search market with tens of billions of dollars in payments to ensure it remained the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers. Beyond calling for a stop to those practices, the DOJ also wants to stop Google from making itself the default search option on its line of Pixel smartphones. Most notably, however, the agency also called on the judge to force the company to sell its flagship Chrome browser.',\n",

Those expenses totaled $40 billion in the first nine months of 2024, according to Baron’s, or nearly 40% of the company’s cost of revenue. Taking those off the table would immediately boost gross margins.',\n",

In just two decades, it has become the largest stock buyer and seller in the U.S.; in August, it facilitated more equity trading within its electronic network than the New York Stock Exchange’s main market. In 2023, Citadel Securities generated $2.8 billion in profit from $6.3 billion in net revenue, with an impressive $4.9 billion in net revenue achieved in the first half of 2024 alone.',\n",

Both arms of the study had low rates of stroke, blood clots and death, which is good news for patients, Oussama Wazni, vice chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, told MedTech Dive.',\n",

When a patient is concerned about continuing oral anticoagulation, we have a choice of a device, and you won't need to take blood thinners long-term,” said Wazni, the study's principal investigator.

       "     'More patients with AFib are undergoing cardiac ablation to treat the condition, but guidelines recommend those at high risk for stroke remain on blood thinners afterward in case of AFib recurrence. However, long-term use of blood thinners poses a risk of serious bleeding.',\n",

       "     'The study of 1,600 patients, called Option, showed the Watchman FLX device was non-inferior to oral anticoagulation, meeting its primary efficacy endpoint of death, stroke or embolism at three years. The rate of those events was 5.3% in the device group vs. 5.8% in the oral anticoagulation group.',\n",
       "     '“The event rate was lower in the investigation on the device arm than oral anticoagulation,” Wazni said.” So it gives us a lot of confidence that it is truly non-inferior to blood thinners and equivalent to blood thinners in reducing the risk of stroke.”',\n",

       "     'A person with AFib may feel their heart quivering, pounding or skipping beats. The condition increases the risk of blood clots and stroke.',\n",
       "     'Doctors are embracing PFA\\xa0to treat AFib amid evidence the approach can restore normal heart rhythm with fewer complications than traditional methods of cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation.

       "     'Farapulse is approved for people who have episodes of AFib that come and go, called paroxysmal AFib, and don’t respond well to medications. Boston Scientific has its sights on additional patient groups as well.',\n",
       "     'One clinical trial underway is studying Farapulse in drug-refractory patients with persistent AFib lasting more than a week. Mahoney expects a label expansion for the indication in the second half of 2025. Boston Scientific is also evaluating the system as a first-line treatment for persistent AFib.',\n",

       "     '“J&J’s large existing presence in PFA could help drive share when it comes to market, especially in cases where mapping is needed,” the analysts said.',\n",

       "     \"To add even more fuel to the fire, Alphabet trades at a lower price than the S&P 500, which trades at 24.6 times forward earnings. Alphabet is a great company that's trading at a huge discount, and I expect both fund managers and investors to take advantage of this price shortly.\",\n",
       "     'I could nearly copy and paste the Alphabet paragraph onto the Meta Platforms portion and have most of the same be true. Instead of search engine dominance, though, Meta has social media dominance.',\n",
       "     'The company derives a massive chunk of revenue through its Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms through advertising. Meta also has generative AI aspirations through its Llama model, which has also become a top choice for anyone developing a model powered by generative AI.',\n",
       "     \"Meta is also executing at a very high level, with revenue rising 19% year over year and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increasing 37%. These are very high levels, considering Meta's size, and show the company's strength.\",\n",
       "     \"One area where it differs from Alphabet is its price tag, as it trades at 24.5 times forward earnings. This is essentially the same price as the S&P 500, but considering how quickly Meta is growing earnings and revenue, it's a cheap stock price.\",\n",
       "     'Meta Platforms could see a further run-up before the end of the year. I think it also makes a great long-term investment.',\n",
       "     \"ASML is quite a bit different than Alphabet and Meta. It doesn't have to do any advertising and is the only company in the world that can build its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines.\",\n",
       "     \"Semiconductor companies use these machines to put traces on chips at microscopic levels. Without ASML's technology, there wouldn't be the same computing capabilities there are today, putting AI advancements on hold.\",\n",
       "     'As ASML is the only company in the world with these capabilities, its machines are highly regulated, and a growing number of them are increasingly outlawed from being sold to China and its allies. This is a problem because China made up nearly 50% of sales in the third quarter.',\n",
       "     \"However, this was an outsized portion, compared to historical averages, and management expects its China revenue share to come down to around 20% in 2025. This decrease also affected ASML's 2025 revenue outlook as it decreased the range from 30 billion to 40 billion euros down to 30 billion to 35 billion euros.\",\n",
       "     \"Investors didn't like that news and sent the stock tumbling following the release. However, management was clear that the long-term growth picture was still intact and that this was just a bump in the road. The damage to the stock has been done, and it now trades at 33 times forward earnings.\",\n",
       "     \"While that may be expensive compared to the other two, it's the cheapest that ASML's stock has been in a long time. Furthermore, ASML has no competition in this space. While the short-term may be a bit bumpy, the long-term trend of consumers using more chips and more powerful chips is undeniable. As a result, ASML is a fantastic buy before 2025.\",\n",

The suggested project would be a component of a larger endeavor by the group to save government expenditure and simplify policies. Talks on the app are still in their early phases as the change of authority and department establishment have not started yet. Under the Inflation Reduction Act, the Biden administration had unveiled a free tax-filing website for 2024. Under the Internal Revenue Service's pilot phase, which let over 100,000 people use the site to submit taxes, Republicans opposed the measure, however, and under the Trump administrationwhich has declared plans to revoke the lawit may encounter further difficulties. Among the concepts under review to completely restructure federal processes under the Trump administration's government transformation program is a possible tax-filing app. Once the government takes office and finishes the changeover process, more developments are predicted. Several businesses in the tax preparation sector might be greatly affected by the planned creation of a free mobile tax-filing application by the Department of Government Efficiency of the Trump administration. Especially notable players that may be impacted include Intuit (INTU, Financials), the producer of TurboTax, and H&R Block (HRB, Financials). After news of the government's possible foray into the tax-filing industry, Intuit's shares dropped more than 5%, suggesting investor worries about further competition. Analogous changes in H&R Block's shares resulted in an 8% decline. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\"}\n",

Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don\\'t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" These high-yield real estate notes that pay 7.5% – 9% make earning passive income easier than ever. The New York Times reported that Musk bought a 14,400-square-foot Tuscan-style villa and plans to add adjoining properties for his expanding family. The paper cited sources claiming he purchased a six-bedroom mansion directly behind the villa, bringing the total investment to $35 million. Musk set the record straight about his family’s living arrangements. His ex, musician Claire Boucher (known professionally as Grimes), lives in Los Angeles with their three children – X Æ A-Xii, Exa Dark Sideræl and Techno Mechanicus. “Our kids spend alternating weeks in Texas and California,” Musk explained. Neuralink executive Shivon Zilis, mother to three of Musk’s children including twins Strider and Azure, has her separate residence. “Shivon has her own house and she bought it for much less than that,” Musk said, referring to the reported $35 million figure. Trending: Invest in $20+ trillion home equity market today across cities like Austin, Miami, and Los Angeles through a unique 5-year term fund targeting a 14-20% IRR with minimums as low as $2,500 The Tesla CEO’s first wife, Justine Musk, also remains in Los Angeles and has no plans to relocate. The former couple, who married from 2000 to 2008, share five children: twins Griffin and Vivian, now 20 and 18-year-old triplets Kai, Saxon and Damian. While nixing the compound rumors, Musk said he has plans for “a big futuristic art project in the Austin area that would be open to the public,” though he noted that his packed schedule has delayed progress. His time is split between Texas and California, where Tesla still requires his presence. “When I’m in California, which is usually two to three days per week, mostly for Tesla work, I stay at friends\\' houses in the Bay Area,” he said. Trending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing — you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. The living arrangement clarifications come as Musk continues relocating his business empire to Texas. In July, he announced plans to move X (formerly Twitter) and SpaceX to Austin, following Tesla’s earlier headquarters shift to the state. The world’s richest man maintains separate households for his children and their mothers while managing his expanding Texas-based business operations, a setup markedly different from the communal family compound described in recent reports.

The goal? To cut down on government waste and make things run smoother, all while saving money. Musk will work alongside Vivek Ramaswamy, which, as many have pointed out, is unusual for a cost-cutting department. But what makes Musk qualified for this role? Well, he’s no stranger to maximizing efficiency in his companies, although this has put him in hot water with the unions. Don\\'t Miss: This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L\\'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here\\'s how there\\'s a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before it closes in a few days. Deloitte\\'s fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for with $1,000 for just $0.25/share  When Musk bought Twitter in 2022, one of his first and most infamous moves was to rebrand it as X and cut down on what he saw as unnecessary perks. Out went the free office lunches and remote work became a thing of the past. As Business Insider reported, Musk demanded an intense commitment from those who stayed, telling employees that tough times were ahead. They needed to work with \"a maniacal sense of urgency.\" He also famously slashed about half of Twitter’s staff, signaling that only the most dedicated would remain. Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. Musk\\'s management style at Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has always been about pushing the limits for himself and his team. Tesla\\'s employee handbook encourages workers to break traditional office rules to solve problems. Employees who think something can be done better are expected to act on it, even if it means reaching out to Musk directly. In a late-night companywide email announcing the layoffs, Musk also demanded the resignation of any Tesla executive with more than three direct reports who \"don\\'t obviously pass the excellent, necessary and trustworthy test.\" Musk has led by example, having spent nights sleeping on the factory floor to show his dedication. This intense work culture, where nothing is more important than getting things done, has helped Tesla keep costs under control while expanding massively.

SpaceX, Musk\\'s aerospace company, also follows a \"ruthlessly efficient\" approach. In 2019, Musk cut 10% of the workforce to ensure the company remained lean enough to achieve its goals. At SpaceX and his other companies, Musk has insisted that workers leave meetings that don\\'t benefit them. Additionally, SpaceX remains steadfast in its goal of lowering the cost of space travel. Still, the company raised its rocket launch prices by around 8% in 2022. Applying it to Government  So, how might Musk\\'s approach translate to government work? Trump believes Musk\\'s private sector successes could bring a much-needed shake-up to Washington.

While the high-end smartphone market remains robust, future licensing gains are increasingly dependent on growth in the automotive and IoT sectors. Despite these challenges, Qualcomm’s stock has risen about 14% this year. It was trading at $165 on Tuesday trading. The San Diego-based company remains the largest supplier of smartphone chips, benefiting from a recovery in the smartphone market as consumers upgrade devices for artificial intelligence applications like chatbots and image generators. Earlier this month, Qualcomm set its fiscal first-quarter revenue target at $10.9 billion, with projected earnings per share of $2.95. The period includes the holiday shopping season in key markets such as the U.S. and Europe, signaling optimism about near-term demand despite looming headwinds.

Why the ban? Jakarta's tough 40% local content rule, designed to boost domestic industries, left Apple locked out of Southeast Asia's largest economy. Initially, Apple floated a $10 million plan for a factory making accessories, but the government wasn't impressed. Now, Apple's going all inten times more cash, aiming to win back access to a booming market of 278 million people, half of whom are under 44 and tech-hungry. Here's the kicker: Apple's market share in Indonesia? Just 2%. But don't let that fool you. iPhone shipments in the country are growing at double-digit rates, with sales projected to hit 2.9 million units this year, up from 2.1 million in 2023. Rising incomes and die-hard Apple fanssome traveling to Singapore just to snag the latest modelsmake Indonesia a strategic hotspot for Apple's future. But the ban threw a wrench into the plan, and Jakarta's asking for even more, pushing Apple to prioritize local R&D in addition to the investment. So, what's the play? For Apple, this isn't just about Indonesia; it's about securing its future in emerging markets as growth in the U.S. and Europe slows. But Indonesia's hardball tactics are a double-edged sword. On one hand, it's a masterclass in leveraging market size to extract foreign investment. On the other, it risks scaring off firms already wary of over-regulation. For Apple, though, this $100 million gamble might just pay offunlocking Southeast Asia's largest economy and solidifying its foothold in one of the fastest-growing tech markets worldwide.

On Monday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin initiated a 2025 year-end S&P 500 target of 6,500, representing about an 11% gain in the benchmark index from current levels. The call falls in line with the 6,500 projection Morgan Stanley made the day prior and just shy of BMO Capital Markets\\' 2025 year-end target of 6,700. \"In our baseline macro outlook, the economy and earnings continue to grow and bond yields remain around current levels,\" Kostin wrote. \"But event risk remains high heading into 2025, including from the potential threat of an across-the-board tariff and the potential risk from even higher bond yields.\" Kostin and others say the market could surge higher even without the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks\\' massive outperformance. His work shows that the combination of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) outperformed the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 by 63 percentage points in 2023 and 22 percentage points thus far this year. In 2024, this was driven by Magnificent Seven earnings outperforming the rest of the index by 30 percentage points. But that margin is projected to fall to just 6 percentage points in 2025, per consensus estimates. This, Kostin believes, will lead to that cohort beating the other 493 stocks by just 7 percentage points in 2025, the narrowest level of outperformance from the Magnificent Seven dating back to 2018. \"The narrowing differential in earnings growth rates should correspond with a narrowing in relative equity returns,\" Kostin wrote. \"Although the \\'micro\\' earnings growth story supports continued ‘Magnificent 7’ outperformance, more \\'macro\\' factors such as economic growth and trade policy lean in favor of the S&P 493.\"\\' Within this call for a broadening of stock market performance within the S&P 500, Goldman also argues that the stocks leading the artificial intelligence trade may begin to shift. Goldman believes gains will shift from a group it has dubbed AI \"infrastructure,\" which includes companies on the ground floor of AI like Nvidia (NVDA), to a group of companies that will have \"enabled revenues\" from AI, meaning those that can use AI to drive sales but aren\\'t actually selling things like AI chips to other companies. The largest companies by market cap in Goldman\\'s enabled revenues basket are Meta and Apple. In the outlook named after Donald Trump\\'s \"Art of the Deal,\" Kostin recommends owning stocks that could be exposed to a pickup in M&A under the president-elect\\'s administration as well as companies who benefit from a pickup in activity among small and medium-size businesses. Kostin cited a pickup in the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) small business optimism index back in November 2016 when Trump was first elected. Goldman identified a list of 60 companies with at least 50% of revenues tied to small businesses. Large companies in that cohort include Meta, Deere & Company (DE), and Waste Management (WM). \"It was truly a reflection of \\'animal spirits\\' coming to life and this behavior is likely to be repeated now that Donald Trump has been elected to serve as the 47th President from January 2025 to January 2029,\" Kostin wrote. \"The valuation of [small business]-exposed stocks reflects the current depressed level of small business sentiment. We expect an improving small business operating environment will boost the sentiment and spending of [small businesses] in 2025 and lift the earnings and valuation of stocks with revenues tied to that spending.\" Josh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Lucid posted an adjusted loss per share of $0.28, narrower than the loss of $0.31 expected, with adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) coming in at a loss of $613.1 million, better than the loss of $634.4 million expected. Earlier, Lucid reported it had produced 1,805 vehicles in Q3, with deliveries coming in at 2,781. The company said today that it was on track to hit its annual production guidance of 9,000 vehicles. Lucid stock was up 3% in early trade on Friday. “Our momentum continues with our third consecutive quarter of record deliveries,” Peter Rawlinson, Lucid CEO and chief technology officer, said in a statement. “Additionally, today we are delighted to open the order book for the much-anticipated Lucid Gravity SUV, a landmark product, which remains on track for the start of production this year.\" The company also said it ended the quarter with $5.16 billion in cash — an important runway as the company begins production of the Gravity. This does not include the approximately $1.75 billion it raised in a share sale earlier last month. “We continue to see improvements to gross margin performance as our cost reduction efforts are gaining momentum,” said Gagan Dhingra, Lucid’s interim CFO, in a statement. “With our recent capital raise, we are pleased to have the continued support once again from both the Public Investment Fund and other institutional investors.” Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), through its affiliate Ayar Third Investment Company, is Lucid’s largest investor. Ayar purchased additional shares during the capital raise to maintain its 58.8% stake. Lucid hopes its upcoming Gravity SUV, expected to begin production later this year, will jump-start sales by a significant margin. “We believe that the total addressable market for Gravity is six times that of Lucid Air,” Rawlinson said in an interview with Yahoo Finance in August. Rawlinson said the company will eventually have capacity at its Arizona plant to build 90,000 Gravity SUVs per year. The big question will be whether Lucid can build the Gravity SUV efficiently and come in below cost. The Gravity is expected to start around $80,000 in the US, right at the eligibility threshold for the federal EV tax credit. Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

ATTRibute-CM was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of acoramidis, an investigational small-molecule stabilizer of transthyretin (TTR) gene. Also Read: BridgeBio Pharma’s Lead Candidate Cuts Mortality, Related Hospitalizations In Patients With Certain Type Of Heart Disease The OLE study involves 330 participants who completed the 30-month ATTRibute-CM Phase 3 study. Key initial results from the OLE study show that continuous treatment with acoramidis led to: A confirmed sustained improvement relative to placebo in time to the first event (\\xa0cardiovascular-related hospitalizations (CVH) or All-Cause Mortality (ACM)) starting at Month 3 in ATTRibute-CM A statistically significant reduction in ACM alone of 36% by Month 36 (p=0.009) and 34% by Month 42 (p=0.006). A significant reduction of composite ACM and CVH by 46% at Month 36 and 48% at Month 42, building upon the previously presented 42% reduction at Month 30 in ATTRibute-CM. Acoramidis continues to be well tolerated, with no new clinically significant safety signals identified in this long-term evaluation. The OLE data build on previously reported results from ATTRibute-CM in which acoramidis demonstrated clinically important treatment effects on mortality, CVH, and quality of life, further supporting that greater transthyretin (TTR) stabilization can improve clinical outcomes for patients. This included a 50% reduction in the cumulative frequency of CVH relative to placebo at Month 30. BridgeBio’s marketing application is under FDA review, with a PDUFA action date of November 29, 2024. It also has a marketing application to the European Medicines Agency, with a decision expected in 2025. BridgeBio has granted Bayer AG (OTC:BAYRY) exclusive rights to commercialize ceramides for ATTR-CM in Europe. William Blair writes that reducing overall mortality is crucial for competing in the ATTR-CM market against Pfizer Inc’s (NYSE:PFE) tafamidis, which already includes proven mortality benefits on its label from the ATTR-ACT trial. The analyst writes, “While Bridge Bio continues to publish analyses of acoramidis demonstrating the TTR stabilizer is safe and efficacious, we deem an on-label claim to all-cause mortality benefit as an important factor for market share in the lucrative, but competitive, ATTR-CM space.” Price Action: BBIO stock is up 0.85% at $22.54 at the last check on Tuesday.

Biosion’s BSI-045B, a novel anti-TSLP monoclonal antibody, is currently in clinical development in the United States for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. Results from a completed phase IIa proof-of-concept study by Biosion demonstrated that BSI-045B has a pharmacodynamic, safety and efficacy profile indicative of its potential as a best-in-class therapy. Several mid-stage studies of the candidate are ongoing in China for severe asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, aiming to accelerate potential proof-of-concept demonstrations for additional indications. The other investigational candidate, per the terms of the licensing deal, is BSI-502, a potential best-in-class, novel bispecific antibody that is directed against both TSLP and IL4R, which is currently in the preclinical stage. However, both candidates are yet to be evaluated by regulatory authorities. Year to date, shares of Aclaris have skyrocketed 199% against the industry’s 6% decline. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Per management, the licensing deal with Biosion concludes Aclaris’ strategic review process to maximize shareholders’ value. The addition of these two potentially transformative treatments is expected to complement Aclaris’ existing ITK inhibitor portfolio, resulting in a pipeline of differentiated assets that target multiple high-value immunologic and respiratory indications. Aclaris’ pipeline currently comprises several candidates undergoing clinical development across various stages for skin disease and cancer indications. Per the terms of the licensing agreement, Aclaris is liable to make a $30 million upfront payment to Biosion for the transfer of global rights to BSI-045B and BSI-502. Biosion is also entitled to receive $4.5 million for certain development costs and $6.2 million for certain development and drug product reimbursement from Aclaris. Moreover, Aclaris is liable to make additional payments of up to $125 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory milestones and up to $795 million upon the achievement of specified sales milestones. Biosion also remains eligible to receive a tiered low-to-mid single-digit royalty based upon a percentage of annual net sales from Aclaris. In a separate press release, ACRS announced a private offering for gross proceeds of approximately\\xa0$80 million, which is expected to close on or about\\xa0Nov. 19, 2024, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. The company intends to use the proceeds from this transaction to fund the research and development of its pipeline and for general corporate purposes. Management believes that this private placement will strengthen Aclaris’ balance sheet and provide enough flexibility to support its strategic growth while maintaining its cash runway into 2028.

But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. We regret to report that long term Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 51% in three years, versus a market return of about 21%. Unfortunately the share price momentum is still quite negative, with prices down 15% in thirty days. This could be related to the recent financial results - you can catch up on the most recent data by reading our company report. After losing 5.3% this past week, it\\'s worth investigating the company\\'s fundamentals to see what we can infer from past performance. See our latest analysis for Pfizer In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. Pfizer saw its EPS decline at a compound rate of 40% per year, over the last three years. This fall in the EPS is worse than the 21% compound annual share price fall. So, despite the prior disappointment, shareholders must have some confidence the situation will improve, longer term. The company\\'s earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Pfizer\\'s earnings, revenue and cash flow. It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Pfizer\\'s TSR for the last 3 years was -44%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there\\'s no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence! While the broader market gained around 32% in the last year, Pfizer shareholders lost 12% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year\\'s performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 3% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should \"buy when there is blood on the streets\", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should learn about the   4 warning signs  we\\'ve spotted with Pfizer (including 2 which shouldn\\'t be ignored) . Pfizer is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find lesser know companies this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.

The price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is often the go-to metric due to its simplicity and ease of use. However, the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is more useful for evaluating stocks of companies that are unprofitable or in early growth stages, as it helps assess value when earnings are minimal or non-existent. While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. A stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth. \\xa0Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with a high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap and a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick. One should analyze other ratios like Price/Earnings, Price/Book and Debt/Equity before arriving at any investment decision.Avangrid AGR, Standard Motor Products SMP, The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. GBX and Pfizer PFE are some companies with a low price-to-sales ratio and the potential to offer higher returns. Price to Sales less than the Median Price to Sales for its Industry: The lower the price-to-sales ratio, the better.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than the Median Price to Earnings for its Industry: The lower, the better.Price to Book (Common Equity) less than the Median Price to Book for its Industry: This is another parameter to ensure the value feature of a stock.Debt to Equity (Most Recent) less than the Median Debt to Equity for its Industry: A company with less debt should have a stable price-to-sales ratio.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2 (Buy): Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 stocks are known to outperform, irrespective of the market environment.Value Score less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are four of the 12 stocks that qualified after the screening:Avangrid is the third-largest solar and wind generator in the United States, with $44 billion of assets. The merger of Iberdrola U.S.A. with The UIL Holdings Corporation in December 2015 led to the formation of Avangrid. Iberdrola owns 81.6% of the outstanding shares of Avangrid.AGR has been committed to its organic growth strategy, emphasizing regulated and contracted investments to ensure steady earnings growth. The company recently introduced an electric vehicle portal and a self-service payment tool to enhance customer satisfaction, lower customer costs and improve cash flow. It has long-term plans to modernize its infrastructure further. Consistent investments, stable dividends, a solid liquidity position, and an expanding wind and solar generation portfolio act as tailwinds. AGR presently has a Value Score of B and a Zacks Rank #2.

It primarily focuses on heavy-duty industrial and the original equipment market. Standard Motor’s customers in the automotive aftermarket comprise the largest national and regional retailers and distributors.SMP is set to benefit from a positive trend in demand for automotive parts, driven by factors like a growing and aging vehicle population, a resurgence in historical driving mileage, and the high cost of new vehicles. The impending acquisition of Nissens will help SMP expand its geographic presence, establish a significant global growth platform and improve cost-saving efforts across all functional areas. SMP currently has a Value Score of A and a Zacks Rank #2.Greenbrier is a leading international supplier of equipment and services to global freight transportation markets. The company’s broad product lineup, extensive market relationships, supportive customer experience, and deep commercial origination capabilities create a unique leadership position and enable ongoing success.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Pfizer Inc. PFE, Newmont Corp. NEM, Uber Technologies Inc. UBER, Adobe Inc. ADBE and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM. U.S. stock markets, in all likelihood, are set to close a solid 2024 after an impressive 2023. Although most of the rally has been driven by an unprecedented adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology across the world, cyclical sectors, such as industrials, financials, consumer discretionary and utilities have also taken part. The bull run is expected to continue in the near future supported by a resilient U.S. economy, a declining inflation rate, solid earnings results, and the Fed’s re-initiation of a low-interest rate regime and accommodative monetary policies. Despite the rally, several stocks have slid from their 52-week highs and are currently available at attractive valuations. Here we recommend five such U.S. giants with a favorable Zacks Rank. These are: Pfizer Inc., Newmont Corp., Uber Technologies Inc., Adobe Inc. and Qualcomm Inc. On Jan 5, I wrote that this year, buying on the dip would be the best strategy. (read: Best Investment Strategy for 2024: Buy on the Dip). Throughout the year, this strategy proved right. Every dip in stocks, especially in tech giants, has resulted in more aggressive returns in a short span. This trend is likely to last in the rest for 2024, too. Any dip should be considered a good buying opportunity. Just a single positive catalyst will lead to a spike in stock prices. Wall Street has plenty of liquidity. At the beginning of 2024, a preliminary estimate revealed that a massive $1.4 trillion entered U.S. money market funds primarily due to an extremely high-interest rate regime, with cash yielding around 5%. A systematic decline in the market interest rate will shift a major part of these gigantic funds to equity markets. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar and President-elect Donald Trump’s “America First” policies should attract more investors to U.S. stock markets. These five stocks are currently available at attractive valuations after sizeable corrections in prices. Moreover, these stocks are set to provide stellar returns in the short term. Each of our picks currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Pfizer Inc. Pfizer’s non-COVID operational revenue growth is improving, driven by its key in-line products like Prevnar, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches, and newly acquired products, including those from Seagen. Although revenues from PFE’s COVID-19 products are declining due to lower demand, huge profits from COVID products have strengthened its cash position. The funds are being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. Seagen’s acquisition has strengthened PFE’s position in the oncology market. Continued growth in non-COVID sales and significant cost-reduction measures should drive PFE’s profit growth. The stock is currently trading at a discount of 21.4% from its 52-week high. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 24.7% from the last closing price of $24.80. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $27-$45. This indicates a maximum upside of 81.5% and no downside. Newmont Corp. Newmont is making notable progress with its growth projects. NEM is likely to gain from several projects, including the Tanami expansion. The acquisition of Newcrest also created an industry-leading portfolio and provided opportunities for significant synergies. NEM also remains focused on improving operational efficiency and returning value to its shareholders. NEM is making notable progress with efficiency improvement programs. Gold prices are hitting record highs this year, and the yellow metal has been among the best-performing assets. The rally has been driven by strong demand from central banks, a dovish Fed interest rate outlook, global uncertainties and a surge in safe-haven demand thanks to geopolitical tensions. Increased tensions in the Middle East and concerns over an economic slowdown also fueled safe-haven demand. The stock is currently trading at a discount of 30.3% from its 52-week high. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 45.8% from the last closing price of $40.93. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $47-$72.32. This indicates a maximum upside of 76.7% and no downside. Uber Technologies Inc. Uber Technologies’ Delivery business benefits from robust online order volumes. UBER’s efforts to expand its delivery operations through successive acquisitions are encouraging. Continued recovery in Mobility operations is also aiding UBER. For fourth-quarter 2024, UBER expects gross bookings of $42.75-$44.25 billion. Apart from the recovery in Mobility operations and the strong performance of the Delivery unit, UBER’s focus on financial discipline is encouraging as well. For fourth-quarter 2024, adjusted EBITDA is estimated between $1.78 billion and $1.88 billion. The stock is currently trading at a discount of 15.8% from its 52-week high. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 27.9% from the last closing price of $73.25. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $66 -$120. This indicates a maximum upside of 63.8% and a maximum downside of 9.9%. Adobe Inc. Zacks Rank #2 Adobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster. Using its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services that help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization. ADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android. The stock is currently trading at a discount of 21.1% from its 52-week high. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 14.4% from the last closing price of $503.37. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703. This indicates a maximum upside of 39.7% and a maximum downside of 12.6%. Qualcomm Inc. Qualcomm is increasingly focusing on the seamless transition from a wireless communications firm for the mobile industry to a connected processor firm for the intelligent edge. With the accelerated rollout of 5G technology, QCOM is benefiting from investments toward building a licensing program in mobile. QCOM formed a strategic collaboration with Google to develop Generative AI digital cockpit solutions. QCOM also recently introduced powerful automotive platforms to bolster the in-vehicle digital experience and facilitate automated driving. These initiatives are driving growth in the automotive business. Strength in the Android smartphone market is a tailwind. The stock is currently trading at a discount of 30.4% from its 52-week high. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 28.4% from the last closing price of $160.50. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $160-$270.

(NYSE:PFE) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. On Thursday, Jim Cramer, host of Mad Money, discussed the current state of the market following the election, noting that it has been marked by extreme volatility, with some sectors experiencing massive gains while others have faced significant losses. Cramer observed a recurring pattern in the market: READ ALSO Jim Cramer on Microsoft and Other Stocks and Jim Cramer’s Best Performers List: Top 10 Stocks Cramer identified certain industries that have seen notable growth, explaining that these sectors have thrived for specific reasons. However, he cautioned that investors should be wary of jumping in too quickly, as these stocks need time to cool off before they become attractive again. In particular, he mentioned how companies with subscription-based models have been seeing a lot of attention, largely because of their steady revenue streams. Another sector Cramer highlighted as being in the midst of a strong rally is enterprise software. He explained that companies in this space, particularly those providing essential products to large corporations, have been soaring. While some sectors are riding high, Cramer also pointed to two areas that are currently undervalued but could see a rebound: pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. He speculated that the pharmaceutical sector has been dragged down in part due to concerns over Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s controversial appointment as the head of the Department of Health and Human Services. However, Cramer suggested that these concerns may already be priced into the stocks. Similarly, Cramer noted that semiconductor stocks have struggled. He said that the hatred comes from doubts surrounding the adoption of artificial intelligence-powered PCs. In his closing remarks, Cramer stressed that while there are plenty of stocks that are currently over-loved, many of them genuinely deserve the attention they’re receiving, but not necessarily at their current inflated prices. As for sectors that seem to be in a perpetual decline, Cramer said he would be interested in buying them, but only after seeing signs that they’ve stopped falling. He added that any potential rebound will depend on greater clarity from President-elect Trump, who he believes could have a significant impact on the market, particularly with his potential to cause turbulence for many stocks. Our Methodology For this article, we compiled a list of 11 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on November 14 and listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). A medical technician wearing protective gloves and a mask mixing a biopharmaceutical solution. Highlighting Pfizer Inc.’s (NYSE:PFE) vaccine business, Cramer said: Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) specializes in discovering, developing, manufacturing, and distributing biopharmaceuticals across a wide range of therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular, infectious diseases, oncology, immunology, and vaccines, with products for chronic conditions, cancer, and COVID-19. A significant development in its growth came in December 2023, when the company completed its $43 billion acquisition of Seagen, a known name in cancer treatments. This strategic move doubled the company’s oncology pipeline, adding 60 experimental oncology programs to its research and development efforts. With this acquisition, the company has created a comprehensive oncology research organization, retaining critical talent and accelerating the development of new therapies. The integration of Seagen is expected to significantly advance Pfizer’s (NYSE:PFE) cancer drug pipeline, which has the potential to produce at least eight blockbuster medicines by 2030, up from five in its current portfolio. In addition to expanding its oncology division, management projects that the company’s pipeline of upcoming medicines will account for approximately 65% of the company’s revenue by 2030. Overall PFE ranks 10th on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently talked about. While we acknowledge the potential of PFE as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

While the strategy can be rewarding, it also often involves a lot of risk, tying up money that could be invested elsewhere and even experiencing losses. But high-stakes investing isn't the only way to put your money to work. The smartest investors, like Warren Buffett, look for steady stocks that can return a lot of capital to shareholders over a long period. Dividend stocks in the S&P 500 can be a good way to play this strategy. Over time, investors can turn pennies into dollars that compound into larger sums. Here are two magnificent S&P 500 dividend stocks down 9% and 21% recently that investors can buy and hold forever. Start Your Mornings Smarter!\\xa0Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.\\xa0Sign Up For Free » Shares of Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ) have fallen roughly 9% since peaking at the start of October and trail the broader market on the year. The dip came after the company reported its third-quarter earnings. Earnings beat expectations modestly, while revenue disappointed due to fewer wireless equipment sales. Investors may have concerns about Verizon's debt, which reached over $128 billion in the third quarter, although that's down from close to $138 billion at the end of 2023. That gives Verizon a debt-to-equity ratio of about 1.32. Investors would prefer to see this ratio lower, but it's not overly worrisome to other highly leveraged companies. A key part of Verizon's strategy is to grow its share in the fiber-optic internet market, which is considered faster and more reliable than cable internet. While the company has work to do, it recently acquired Frontier Communications for $20 billion in cash. The transaction will grow Verizon's fiber-optic scale by adding 2.2 million fiber-optic subscribers and bringing its total network to 25 million. The strategy may take time to play out, and Verizon is compensating investors with a very generous 6.5% dividend yield. This dividend seems sustainable, considering Verizon has increased its dividend for 18 straight years. The company's quarterly payout ratio, which looks at how much of the dividend is covered by earnings, can vary but typically comes in at less than 60%, so this is a relatively safe dividend stock that investors should be able to buy and hold forever. Ford's (NYSE: F) stock has fallen nearly 22% from highs seen in mid-July of this year, and earnings were once again behind the drop. Ford's earnings fell short of what analysts had been projecting due to vehicle recalls and warranty costs, which chipped away at earnings. Ford's electric vehicle business also continues to lose money. Things got better for Ford in the third quarter after the auto giant squeaked out a beat and guided for earnings before interest and taxes to the low end of its prior guidance, which was better than some analysts expected. Some feared that Ford might have to lower guidance. The company also improved its warranty costs and took a smaller loss in its EV division than one year ago. These developments represented an improvement but did not necessarily impress the market. President-Elect Donald Trump's policies may end up benefiting Ford. Trump has vowed to eliminate EV tax credits, cut corporate taxes, and impose tariffs, all of which should benefit domestic automakers. Ford is trying to build its EV business, but its traditional car business is still at the center of the company right now. The stock currently has a hearty 5.4% dividend yield. The payout ratio was elevated in the third quarter, but the company typically targets a sustainable payout ratio of 40% to 50%. The business has challenges ahead, but the company has been a staple of the American economy for decades, and I expect it to continue to be for many decades more while continuing to pay a healthy dividend.

For comparison, that same investment in an S&P 500 index fund would only generate about $60 of annual income each year. Here's a look at each company. Clearway Energy is a leading clean power producer. The company generates renewable energy and electricity from environmentally sound natural gas-fired power plants. It sells this power to utilities and large corporate customers under long-term, fixed-rate power purchase agreements. The company pays most of its stable cash flow to investors in dividends. It uses the cash it retains and its financial flexibility to acquire additional income-generating clean power assets. Clearway cashed in on the value of its thermal assets a few years ago and has been recycling the capital into higher-returning renewable energy assets. That strategy has it on track to deliver dividend growth near the top end of its 5% to 8% target range through 2026. Meanwhile, it's already securing growth for 2027 and beyond, positioning it to continue increasing its dividend within its target range in the future. Enterprise Products Partners is a master limited partnership (MLP) focused on the energy midstream sector. It generates stable cash flow backed by long-term, fixed-rate contracts and government-regulated rate structures. The company distributes a little more than half its cash flow to investors, retaining the rest to fund expansion projects and maintain its elite balance sheet. The MLP has increased its distribution for 26 years, which should continue. Enterprise has $6.9 billion of major growth capital projects underway, giving it visibility into its ability to grow its cash flows through the end of 2026. That visible growth makes the MLP an ideal passive income investment for those comfortable receiving a K-1 federal tax form each year. EPR Properties is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on owning experiential properties, like movie theaters, eat-and-play venues, and attractions. It leases these properties to operating companies. Those leases provide it with relatively stable rental income. The REIT pays investors about 70% of its steady cash flow via its monthly dividend. It retains the rest to invest in additional income-generating experiential real estate. The company invested $214.6 million through the first nine months of the year. It has also committed to invest $150 million into experiential development and redevelopment projects over the next two years. These investments should grow its income, enabling the REIT to continue increasing its dividend. Verizon is a leader in the telecom sector. The company's mobile and broadband businesses generate lots of recurring revenue and cash flow. That gives Verizon money to invest in expanding its infrastructure while also paying a lucrative dividend. The company has increased its payout for 18 straight years -- the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. That upward trend should continue. Verizon produces more cash than it needs to invest in its business and pay its dividend, which has enabled it to strengthen its balance sheet. That's allowing Verizon to buy Frontier Communications in a $20 billion all-cash deal to bolster its fiber network. That deal will also increase its earnings, driven in part by the expectation that it will capture over $500 million in annual cost savings. The growing cash flow from these investments should enable Verizon to continue increasing its dividend payment. W. P. Carey is a diversified REIT. It owns operationally critical warehouse, industrial, and retail properties. Those properties produce stable rental income that steadily rises at either a fixed rate or one tied to inflation. The REIT is in the middle of a portfolio refresh. It has exited the office sector and sold off some other noncore properties over the past year. It's recycling that capital into new properties, predominately in the stronger industrial sector. W.P. Carey has already completed nearly $1 billion of new investments this year and had more than $500 million of additional deals in its pipeline. Those new investments are growing the REIT's cash flow, allowing it to rebuild its dividend (it has increased its payment three times after resetting it last year as part of its office exit). With a strong balance sheet, a lower dividend payout ratio after the reset, and more noncore properties to recycle, W. P. Carey is in an excellent position to continue growing its portfolio, cash flow, and dividend. The average stock currently has a low dividend yield these days due to surging prices. However, there are still some great income stocks available, including Clearway Energy, EPR Properties, Enterprise Products Partners, Verizon, and W. P. Carey. They can enable you to generate a lot more income for every dollar you invest.

You can see all of today’s research reports here >>> Linde’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Chemical – Specialty industry over the past two years (+35.9% vs. -0.6%). The Zacks analyst believes that Linde’s long-term contracts with key on-site clients featuring minimum purchase agreements have helped stabilize earnings during economic downturns. Also, a robust business model has ensured that it has continued to reward its shareholders with dividends. However, increasing competition for new projects and volatility of energy prices, particularly for natural gas and diesel fuel, presents a significant concern for profitability. (You can read the full research report on Linde here >>>) Verizon’s shares have underperformed the Zacks Wireless - National industry over the last six months (+1.5% vs. +25.4%). The Zacks analyst believes that lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues are major concerns for the company. Huge promotional expenses, lucrative discounts to expand the customer base, high capital expenditures for continuous network upgrades and fiber deployment are also acting as major headwinds. Yet, customer-focused planning and disciplined engineering and steady infrastructure investments have helped. Also, by pioneering new technologies, Verizon is well-positioned to bridge the digital divide and enhance the connectivity landscape nationwide. (You can read the full research report on Verizon here >>>) Shares of AT&T have outperformed the Zacks Wireless - National industry over the last six months (+28.7% vs. +25.4%). Per the Zacks analyst, the company is likely to benefit from the increased deployment of mid-band spectrum and greater fiber densification. A planned commercial-scale open radio access network across the country will also help build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers. However, steady decline in linear TV subscribers and legacy services is a potent headwind. Healthy discounts and freebies to woo customers bring down margins. Debt burden is high.

Are You Missing The Morning Scoop?\\xa0Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.\\xa0Sign Up For Free » Truist Securities analyst William Stein maintained a buy rating on Nvidia stock while increasing his price target to $167. For investors keeping score at home, that represents potential gains of 19% compared to Monday\\'s closing price. The analyst believes Nvidia is a buy ahead of its earnings, as he thinks there\\'s still potential upside compared to Wall Street\\'s current expectations. He cites increasing demand in the data center market, which is the repository for the vast majority of AI systems and models. Not to be outdone, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy maintained a buy rating on Nvidia stock while increasing his price target to $180. This represents potential upside of 28% compared to Monday\\'s closing price. The analyst believes Nvidia will \"beat and raise,\" beating Wall Street\\'s consensus estimates for the quarter while also increasing its guidance for the full year. He points out that expectations have been rising ahead of Nvidia\\'s fiscal 2025 third-quarter results, which will be released after the market close on Wednesday. He cites supply chain checks as supporting robust demand for Nvidia\\'s soon-to-be-released Blackwell architecture. Nvidia dialed back expectations when the company issued its last quarterly report, but the results are expected to be robust nonetheless. For its fiscal 2025 third quarter (ended Sept. 29), the company guided for revenue of $32.5 billion, which would represent growth of 79%, with a corresponding uptick in profitability. Investors will also be watching Nvidia\\'s gross margin, which was slightly lower in Q2 after hitting a new record in the first quarter. Another area of interest will be progress regarding the company\\'s upcoming Blackwell AI-centric processor release, which is expected to kick off later this year. Nvidia stock is currently selling for 33 times next year\\'s earnings, but I\\'d argue that\\'s a small price to pay for a company that\\'s widely considered the gold standard for AI processing.

The company is now launching its next-generation Blackwell graphics processing units (GPUs), and expectations are high heading into the company's Q3 report tomorrow. Today's news suggesting that reported overheating issues for the Blackwell processors had actually already been addressed is a promising indicator, and the bullish momentum was strengthened by positive coverage from two high-profile analyst firms. Citing a strong demand outlook heading into 2025, Truist raised its one-year target on Nvidia stock from $148 per share to $167 per share. Stifel was even more bullish, maintaining a buy rating on the stock and raising its one-year price target from $165 per share to $180 per share. With its last quarterly update, Nvidia guided for sales of roughly $32.5 billion in Q3 -- good for year-over-year growth of roughly 80%. The company also targeted a non-GAAP (adjusted) gross margin of approximately 75%, and performance in the category will be under the microscope as investors look for indications as to whether the company can sustain the strong pricing power that it's enjoyed amid the AI boom. Investors should approach the stock with the understanding that Wall Street's expectations are even higher than Nvidia's own guidance, and it's possible that the company's share price could slip even if the AI leader beats the average-analyst sales and earnings estimates. As a long-term investment, Nvidia stock still holds plenty of promise. The company has a dominant position in the market for advanced GPUs for AI applications, and its industry-leading software platform gives it competitive advantages that complement its hardware performance lead. On the other hand, the stock could be volatile coming out of earnings, and investors may want to adopt a dollar-cost-averaging strategy rather than buying a large amount of stock all at once.

The chipmaker at the forefront of the artificial-intelligence boom rose 4.9%, leading gains in the S&P 500. An earlier slide in equities was driven by Ukraine’s first strike with US missiles in Russia and President Vladimir Putin’s approval of an updated nuclear doctrine. To Gaurav Mallik at Pallas Capital Advisors, geopolitical uncertainties are indeed a recipe for volatility. As for Nvidia’s results, he’s expecting strong numbers, citing capital expenditure by big tech and his view that there’s still “no clear substitute” for the company’s chips. “This market is fickle,” said Nancy Tengler at Laffer Tengler Investments. “Stocks ultimately trade on earnings and they have been great. I don’t recommend stocks ahead of earnings, but if NVDA sells off, jump in.” The S&P 500 added 0.4%. The Nasdaq 100 climbed 0.7%. A gauge of the “Magnificent Seven” megacaps advanced 1.7%.

About multiple myeloma Multiple\\xa0myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.1 In multiple myeloma, these plasma cells proliferate and spread rapidly and replace normal cells in the bone marrow with tumors.2 Multiple myeloma is the third most common blood cancer worldwide and remains an incurable disease.3 In 2024, it was estimated that more than 35,000 people will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the U.S. and more than 12,000 people would die from the disease.4 People living with multiple myeloma have a 5-year survival rate of 59.8 percent.5 While some people diagnosed with multiple myeloma initially have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, tiredness, high calcium levels and kidney problems or infections.6,7 About smoldering multiple myeloma Smoldering multiple\\xa0myeloma is an asymptomatic precursor state to multiple myeloma (MM). Patients with SMM have higher levels of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and an elevated monoclonal protein (M-protein) level in the blood, but they do not yet exhibit the symptoms commonly associated with active multiple myeloma, particularly end-organ damage. Fifteen percent of all cases of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma are classified as smoldering multiple myeloma, and half of those diagnosed with high-risk disease will progress to active multiple myeloma within two years.8 About warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia Warm\\xa0autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) is a rare, life-threatening condition where autoantibodies lead to the premature destruction of red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in anemia, which can cause symptoms like debilitating fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, jaundice and in severe cases, chest pain or loss of consciousness.9 Approximately 1-3 new people per 100,000 are affected by wAIHA per year, and about 1 in 8,000 individuals are living with the condition.9,10\\xa0This condition affects both women and men and can affect people at any age with incidence increasing over the age of 50.10,11 There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs indicated for wAIHA, and treatment typically consists of corticosteroids, broad immunosuppressants and B-cell directed therapies.9\\xa0With an unmet need for treatment in wAIHA, continued research for evidence-based potential therapies is critical.12 About fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a rare and potentially life-threatening alloimmune condition in which a pregnant person\\'s immune system develops alloantibodies against fetal or newborn platelet antigens, leading to thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the fetus or newborn.13 FNAIT can result in severe bleeding complications for a fetus or newborn and is characterized by organ bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or eyes.13 If a severe bleed occurs in the brain, termed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), death or life-long neurologic effects may occur.13\\xa0ICH occurs in up to 26 percent of untreated pregnancies with FNAIT.14 It has an estimated incidence rate of 1 in 1000 pregnancies.13,15\\xa0 There are no approved therapies for the treatment of FNAIT. Because FNAIT is not routinely screened for during pregnancy, the diagnosis of an affected FNAIT pregnancy often occurs postnatally.13 About DARZALEX®\\xa0and DARZALEX\\xa0FASPRO® DARZALEX\\xa0FASPRO®\\xa0(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj)\\xa0received\\xa0U.S. FDA approval in May 2020 and is approved for nine indications in multiple myeloma, four of which are for frontline treatment in newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible or ineligible.16 It is the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with MM. DARZALEX\\xa0FASPRO®\\xa0is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20, Halozyme\\'s ENHANZE®\\xa0drug delivery technology. DARZALEX®\\xa0(daratumumab) received\\xa0U.S. FDA approval in November 2015 and is approved in eight indications, three of which are in the frontline setting, including newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible and ineligible.17 DARZALEX®\\xa0is the first CD38-directed antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma.17\\xa0DARZALEX®-based regimens have been used in the treatment of more than 585,000 patients worldwide and more than 239,000 patients in the U.S. alone. In\\xa0August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab. Since 2020, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network®\\xa0(NCCN®) has recommended daratumumab-based combination regimens for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.†\\xa0For newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in non-transplant candidates, the NCCN®\\xa0guidelines recommend daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone as a Category 1 preferred regimen; daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone as another recommended Category 1 regimen; and daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone as another recommended Category 2A regimen. For newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in transplant candidates, the NCCN®\\xa0guidelines recommend daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone as another recommended Category 2A regimen; daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances; daratumumab in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances; and daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances. For maintenance in transplant candidates, the NCCN® guidelines recommend daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide as useful in certain circumstances. In relapsed/refractory myeloma, four daratumumab regimens are listed as Category 1 preferred regimens for early relapses (1-3 prior therapies): daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone; daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone; daratumumab in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone; and daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone [after one prior therapy including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor]. The NCCN®\\xa0also recommends daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone as another Category 2A regimen for early relapses (1-3 prior therapies) and as monotherapy as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances for early relapse patients after at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, or for patients who are double refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.

About CARVYKTI® CARVYKTI® is a BCMA-directed, genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy that involves reprogramming a patient\\'s own T-cells with a transgene encoding chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that directs the CAR-positive T cells to eliminate cells that express BCMA. BCMA is primarily expressed on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B-lineage cells, as well as late-stage B cells and plasma cells. The CARVYKTI® CAR protein features two BCMA-targeting single domains designed to confer high avidity against human BCMA. Upon binding to BCMA-expressing cells, the CAR promotes T-cell activation, expansion, and elimination of target cells. CARVYKTI® (cilta-cel) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval\\xa0in February 2022 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. In April 2024, CARVYKTI® was approved\\xa0in the U.S. for\\xa0 treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and who are refractory to lenalidomide, following a unanimous (11 to 0) FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) recommendation in support of this new indication. In April 2024, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved\\xa0a Type II variation for CARVYKTI® for the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor, have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, and are refractory to lenalidomide. In December 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Legend Biotech USA, Inc. to develop and commercialize CARVYKTI®.

About TECVAYLI® TECVAYLI® (teclistamab-cqyv) received approval from the U.S. FDA in October 2022 as an off-the-shelf (or ready-to-use) antibody that is administered as a subcutaneous treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody.18 The EC granted TECVAYLI® conditional marketing authorization (CMA) in August 2022 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with RRMM who have received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody, and have demonstrated disease progression since the last therapy. In August 2023, the EC granted the approval of a Type II variation application for TECVAYLI®, providing the option for a reduced dosing frequency of 1.5 mg/kg every two weeks in patients who have achieved a complete response or better for a minimum of six months. TECVAYLI® is a first-in-class, bispecific T-cell engager antibody therapy that uses innovative science to activate the immune system by binding to the CD3 receptor expressed on the surface of T-cells and to the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and some healthy B-lineage cells. In February 2024, the U.S. FDA approved the supplemental Biologics License Application for TECVAYLI® for a reduced dosing frequency of 1.5 mg/kg every two weeks in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have achieved and maintained a CR or better for a minimum of six months. For more information, visit www.TECVAYLI.com. About TALVEY® TALVEY® (talquetamab-tgvs) received\\xa0approval from the U.S. FDA in August 2023 as a first-in-class GPRC5D-targeting bispecific antibody for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 antibody.19\\xa0Since FDA approval, 1,800 patients were treated with TALVEY®. The European Commission (EC) granted\\xa0conditional marketing authorization\\xa0(CMA) of TALVEY®\\xa0(talquetamab-tgvs) in August 2023 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.20 TALVEY®\\xa0is a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody that binds to the CD3 receptor expressed on the surface of T-cells and G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), a novel multiple myeloma target which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and non-malignant plasma cells, as well as some healthy tissues such as epithelial cells of the skin and tongue. About IMBRUVICA® IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) is a once-daily oral medication that is jointly developed and commercialized by Janssen Biotech, Inc., and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. IMBRUVICA® blocks the BTK protein, which is needed by normal and abnormal B cells, including specific cancer cells, to multiply and spread. By blocking BTK, IMBRUVICA® may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments and inhibit their proliferation.21,22, 23 IMBRUVICA® is approved in more than 100 countries and has been used to treat more than 300,000 patients worldwide over the last decade. There are more than 50 company-sponsored clinical trials, including 18 Phase 3 studies, spanning more than 11 years evaluating the efficacy and safety of IMBRUVICA®. IMBRUVICA® was first approved by the U.S. FDA in November 2013, and today is indicated for adult patients in four disease areas. These include indications to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma with or without 17p deletion; adults with Waldenström\\'s macroglobulinemia; and adult and pediatric patients aged one year and older with previously treated chronic graft versus host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy.24 About Nipocalimab Nipocalimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody, designed to bind with high affinity to block FcRn and reduce levels of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies potentially without impact on other immune functions. This includes autoantibodies and alloantibodies that underlie multiple conditions across three key segments in the autoantibody space including Rare Autoantibody diseases, Maternal Fetal diseases mediated by maternal alloantibodies and Prevalent Rheumatology.25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33\\xa0Blockade of IgG binding to FcRn in the placenta is also believed to limit transplacental transfer of maternal alloantibodies to the fetus.34,35 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted several key designations to nipocalimab including: U.S. FDA Fast Track designation in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and wAIHA in July 2019, gMG in December 2021 and FNAIT in March 2024 U.S. FDA Orphan drug status for wAIHA in December 2019, HDFN in June 2020, gMG in February 2021, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in October 2021 and FNAIT in December 2023 U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for HDFN in February 2024 and for Sjögren\\'s disease (SjD) in November 2024 EU EMA Orphan medicinal product designation for HDFN in October 2019 About Johnson & Johnson At Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson & Johnson belongs, has lost 14.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Johnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $1.99 per share, indicating a change of -13.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.93 points to a change of +0.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.54 indicates a change of +6.1% from what Johnson & Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson & Johnson. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Johnson & Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.54 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $88.84 billion and $91.25 billion estimates indicate -4.5% and +2.7% changes, respectively. Johnson & Johnson reported revenues of $22.47 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.3%. EPS of $2.42 for the same period compares with $2.66 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.27%. The EPS surprise was +9.01%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period. Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Johnson & Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson & Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily BioPharma Dive newsletter. An experimental pill developed by Johnson & Johnson and Protagonist Therapeutics significantly cleared skin in most people with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who enrolled in a Phase 3 trial run by J&J. Treatment with the drug, called icotrokinra, led to clear or almost clear skin in about two-thirds of participants after four months of testing. Just under half experienced a 90% or greater reduction in their scores on another measure of psoriasis plaque coverage and severity. Only 8% and 4%, respectively, of study participants on placebo hit those same marks. Responses to icotrokinra improved further through six months and, according to a Monday statement from J&J, a similar percentage of participants in both trial groups experienced side effects. The company plans to present detailed results at an upcoming medical meeting. Icotrokinra is the product of a research collaboration\\xa0J&J and Protagonist struck just over seven years ago. It’s meant to match, or at least come close to, the effectiveness of injectable drugs now commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions like psoriasis, but with the convenience of being taken orally. Drugmakers the industry over have embarked on a similar mission, investing in medicines aimed at an array of enzymes and proteins that help control the body’s immune response. Icotrokinra takes aim at receptor known as IL-23, blocking the same signaling pathway as AbbVie’s fast-selling injection Skyrizi and J&J’s own Tremfya. The good news from Monday’s results, according to Leerink Partners’ David Risinger, is that icotrokinra’s efficacy seems “roughly comparable” to the older injectable drug Stelara and potentially “superior” to oral drugs like Sotyktu\\xa0and Otezla that are approved for psoriasis. However, the analyst wrote in a client note Tuesday, icotrokinra seems less effective than Skyrizi and Tremfya, which may limit its ability to directly replace those treatments. The main measures of success in J&J’s study, called ICONIC-LEAD, were improvements on the Investigator's Global Assessment, or IGA, and the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, or PASI. Scores of 0 or 1 on IGA correspond to clear or nearly clear skin and, by week 24, 74% of icotrokinra-treated participants met that criteria. PASI, by comparison, measures the total area of skin affected by psoriasis plaques, as well as how red and thick those plaques are. So-called PASI 90 refers to a 90% or greater improvement in PASI scores compared to baseline measurements. About half of the people on icotrokinra hit this threshold by week 16, and 65% did by week 24. Adjusted for placebo response rates through week 16, icotrokinra’s 45% rate on PASI 90 is well below the roughly 70% rate seen in trials of Skyrizi and Tremfya, according to Risinger. Still, Risinger expects J&J can eventually meet its forecast of greater than $5 billion in peak annual sales of icotrokinra, as he sees it helping expand the market share of IL-23 drugs. In addition to announcing data from ICONIC-LEAD, J&J also said that another Phase 3 study, ICONIC-TOTAL, succeeded, showing once-daily icotrokinra met its main goal on IGA compared to placebo by week 16. Results from both studies will be included in approval applications J&J is now preparing. The company is also testing its drug against Sotyktu, which is sold by Bristol Myers Squibb, in two Phase 3 trials of people with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Studies evaluating icotrokina in psoriatic arthritis are set to begin next year, while results from a Phase 2 test in ulcerative colitis are anticipated before June. As a result of icotrokinra’s success in Phase 3, Protagonist has earned $165 million in milestone payments from J&J, which the biotechnology company said it expects to receive from J&J in the first quarter.\"}\n",

ICONIC-LEAD is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotrokinra compared with placebo in participants 12 years of age or older with moderate to severe plaque\\xa0PsO, with the higher efficacy bar of PASI 90 and IGA score of 0/1 with at least a 2-grade improvement as co-primary endpoints. ICONIC-LEAD enrolled 66 adolescent patients. b. The PASI score grades the amount of surface area on each body region that is covered by psoriasis plaques and the severity of plaques for their redness, thickness and scaliness.5\\xa0PASI 90 corresponds to an improvement of >=90% in PASI score from baseline.5 c. The IGA is a five-point scale with a severity ranging from 0 to 4, where 0 indicates clear, 1 is minimal, 2 is mild, 3 is moderate, and 4 indicates severe disease.6 d. ICONIC-TOTAL is a RCT to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared with placebo for the treatment of PsO in participants with at least moderate severity affecting special areas (e.g., scalp, genital, and/or hands and feet) with overall IGA score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2-grade improvement as the primary endpoint. About the ICONIC Clinical Development ProgramThe pivotal Phase 3 ICONIC clinical development program of icotrokinra (JNJ-2113) in adult and adolescent individuals with moderate to severe plaque\\xa0PsO was initiated with two studies in Q4 2023 – ICONIC-LEAD and ICONIC-TOTAL – pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement between Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. and Janssen Biotech, Inc.7 ICONIC-LEAD (NCT06095115) is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotrokinra compared with placebo in participants with moderate to severe plaque\\xa0PsO, with PASI 90 and IGA score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2-grade improvement as co-primary endpoints.8 ICONIC-TOTAL (NCT06095102) is a RCT to evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotrokinra compared with placebo for the treatment of PsO in participants with at least moderate severity affecting special areas (e.g., scalp, genital, and/or hands and feet) with overall IGA score of 0 or 1 with at least a 2-grade improvement as the primary endpoint.9 Other Phase 3 studies in the development program include ICONIC-ADVANCE 1 (NCT06143878) and ICONIC-ADVANCE 2 (NCT06220604), which evaluate the safety and efficacy of icotrokinra compared with both placebo and deucravacitinib in adults with moderate to severe plaque\\xa0PsO.10 About Plaque PsoriasisPlaque psoriasis (PsO) is a chronic immune-mediated disease resulting in overproduction of skin cells, which causes inflamed, scaly plaques that may be itchy or painful.11 It is estimated that eight million Americans and more than 125 million people worldwide live with the disease.12 Nearly one-quarter of all people with plaque PsO have cases that are considered moderate to severe.12 On Caucasian skin, plaques typically appear as raised, red patches covered with a silvery white buildup of dead skin cells or scale.13 On skin of color, the plaques may appear darker and thicker and more of a purple, gray or dark brown color.13\\xa0Plaques can appear anywhere on the body, although they most often appear on the scalp, knees, elbows, and torso.13\\xa0Living with plaque PsO can be a challenge and impact life beyond a person\\'s physical health, including emotional health, relationships, and handling the stressors of life.14 Psoriasis on highly visible areas of the body or sensitive skin, such as the scalp, hands, feet, and genitals, can have an increased negative impact on quality of life.13,15 About Icotrokinra (JNJ-77242113, JNJ-2113)Investigational icotrokinra is the first targeted oral peptide designed to selectively block the IL-23 receptor,3 which underpins the inflammatory response in moderate to severe plaque\\xa0PsO and other IL-23-mediated diseases.16,17\\xa0Icotrokinra binds to the IL-23 receptor with single-digit picomolar affinity and demonstrated potent, selective inhibition of IL-23 signaling in human T cells.18 The license and collaboration agreement established between Protagonist Therapeutics, Inc. and Janssen Biotech, Inc., in 2017 enabled the companies to work together to discover and develop next-generation compounds that ultimately led to icotrokinra.19 Icotrokinra was jointly discovered and is being developed pursuant to the license and collaboration agreement between Protagonist and Johnson & Johnson. Johnson & Johnson retains exclusive worldwide rights to develop icotrokinra in Phase 2 clinical trials and beyond, and to commercialize compounds derived from the research conducted pursuant to the agreement against a broad range of indications.20,21,22 About Johnson & JohnsonAt\\xa0Johnson & Johnson,\\xa0we believe health is everything.

Kennedy Jr. could impact the healthcare sector as secretary of health', 'Publisher': 'Yahoo Finance', 'Link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-could-impact-the-healthcare-sector-as-secretary-of-health-182748442.html', 'Provider Publish Time': 1731954468, 'Type': 'STORY', 'Related Tickers': 'JNJ, NONOF, NVO, LLY, PFE', 'Text': 'President-elect Donald Trump\\'s nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation’s top health agency sent healthcare stocks sliding last week. Vaccine makers like Moderna (MRNA) were down more than 5%, while larger companies like Pfizer PFE (PFE) were down about 2%. Some Wall Street analysts said the slide was an overreaction and that it\\'s too early to tell if or how much Kennedy could impact the healthcare sector since little is known about the controversial pick\\'s actual policies and he has yet to be confirmed by the US Senate. If confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services, Kennedy would oversee the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). JPMorgan healthcare analyst Chris Schott said in a note to clients that the sector is facing “a period of max uncertainty” until the Cabinet position is filled and more is known about Kennedy. But, Schott added, it also means that the large-cap stocks, as a whole, are currently trading at a 35% discount to the S&P 500, leaving room for future upside rather than more downside trading. Mizuho’s healthcare sector expert Jared Holz said in a note to clients that he agrees with some of the big-picture issues Kennedy has identified, such as America\\'s obesity epidemic and the dangers of ultra-processed foods. “The country should be much healthier than it is and there is a ton of room for improvement, including nutrition, food production, consumption, etc. This is a very complicated topic and always has been,” Holz said. Here\\'s some of what we do know about Kennedy\\'s views on major healthcare topics. Vaccines: Known as an anti-vaxxer, Kennedy has questioned the need to vaccinate children and refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine, concerning some Wall Street analysts about his possible effect on the vaccine industry and how he could influence the childhood vaccine schedule, as well as the regulatory process to test and approve vaccines and other treatments. There is also speculation he and Trump’s government efficiency appointees, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, could gut the FDA. Vaccine stocks were hurt the most on the news of Kennedy\\'s nomination, despite him previously saying he wasn’t “taking away” anybody’s vaccines. GLP-1s: RFK has said he doesn’t believe the weekly injectables are the solution to the country’s obesity problem. It is unclear if he could derail current efforts by GLP-1 makers to gain Medicare coverage, which is currently not allowed for obesity. Companies are studying the drugs\\' impacts on obesity-related diseases such as heart disease and sleep apnea, which are covered by Medicare and would therefore open up federal dollars for purchase. A recent report showed Medicaid, which would also be under Kennedy\\'s purview, has contributed significantly to sales of the injectables compared to employer-sponsored and commercial insurance plans. Some analysts fear Kennedy\\'s positions could limit access to the drugs and levels of coverage, potentially impacting the fortunes of market leaders Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). Holz, however, said he “still believes GLP-1s will be the largest therapeutic category by a wide margin despite some comments from RFK noting that Americans should use other non-drug methods in order to lose weight.” Drug pricing: With oversight of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Kennedy would have a chance to negotiate more or less aggressively with pharmaceutical companies than the Biden administration. That is, of course, if the Trump administration chooses to continue exercising the new powers established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). \"President Trump will still be focused on this issue and could seek to \\'get a better deal\\' via IRA negotiations than the Biden administration,\" Leerink Partners said in a note. Food regulations: Kennedy has been vocal about prioritizing the regulation of ultra-processed foods. Studies show these foods are contributing to obesity in the country. It\\'s a policy the current FDA commissioner, Robert Califf, has already spoken about, and the agency has been looking to issue new rules on labeling, as well as better research on the impacts of these foods. While of more concern to food stocks than healthcare, the issue is related to his stance on obesity and GLP-1s. It is unclear how Kennedy would tackle this issue.

Johnson & Johnson appointed Chris Della Rocca as its SVP, CIO of corporate business technology, the executive said Monday in a LinkedIn post. Della Rocca, whose career at J&J spans nearly 20 years, most recently served as CIO of technical operations and risk, a role he took on in January. The executive will oversee technology strategy for all corporate functions, including HR, finance, legal, corporate affairs, and technical operations and risk, the company said in an email. Della Rocca has taken on several CIO roles for J&J since 2019, when he became CIO for the company\\'s Janssen Pharmaceuticals Americas division. \"We’re excited about the leadership and experience Chris brings to this role as we continue advancing healthcare through technology,\" a company spokesperson said in an email. Della Rocca will report to EVP and CIO Jim Swanson, who joined J&J in 2019 after stints at Bayer, Monsanto and Merck. More organizations are expanding the business influence of CIOs as operations become more technology driven. Alongside the increase in cloud, technology chiefs are seeing their performance measured in terms of profitability, according to ServiceNow data. Technology leadership at Johnson & Johnson has worked to plug AI into operations and product development. \"The technology is currently being used to help our employees detect disease at earlier stages, accelerate drug discovery, assist with clinical trial recruitment, map a patient’s anatomy before a procedure and help surgeons predict the best tool for surgery,\" Swanson said in a release published last month.

The CHMP has recommended the Rybrevant-Lazcluze combination as a first-line treatment for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletions (ex19del) or exon 21 L858R substitution (L858R) mutations. The FDA approved this combination in August for a similar indication. This recommendation is based on data from the phase III MARIPOSA study, which evaluated the Rybrevant-Lazcluze combo against AstraZeneca’s AZN blockbuster oncology drug Tagrisso in patients with the above indication. Data from the MARIPOSA study showed that treatment with the JNJ combination therapy reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 30% compared with\\xa0AZN’s Tagrisso. Patients who took the combo achieved a median duration of response (mDOR) that was nine months longer than those treated with the AstraZeneca drug. Year to date, J&J’s shares have moved down 1.8% against the industry’s 3.3% growth. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research In August, the European Commission approved the combination of Rybrevant and standard-of-care chemotherapy (carboplatin and pemetrexed) for treating adult patients with advanced NSCLC with EGFR ex19del or L858R mutations after failure of prior therapy, including an EGFR-TKI. This combination received the FDA’s approval for use in a similar indication in September. Rybrevant also received approval for a third indication in the United States. In March, the FDA approved the combination of Rybrevant and chemotherapy (carboplatin-pemetrexed) for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations. The combination is also approved for a similar indication in the EU. Through these approvals, the J&J drug intends to take on AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso, which is the current standard of care for EGFR-mutated NSCLC. In June, J&J submitted a regulatory filing with the FDA seeking approval for a subcutaneous formulation of Rybrevant for all currently approved or submitted indications of the drug. Per management, the FDA granted this filing a priority designation in August. Apart from NSCLC, J&J is also evaluating Rybrevant in other cancer indications. In September, management reported new data from the phase Ib/II OrigAMI-1 study, which evaluated the combination of Rybrevant plus chemotherapy in certain patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.\\xa0Patients who received the combo therapy achieved an overall response rate of 49% and a disease control rate of 88%.

ASTS reported modest third-quarter 2024 results, with adjusted earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missing the same.Net loss in the reported quarter was $171.9 million or $1.10 per share compared with a loss of $20.9 million or 23 cents per share in the year-ago quarter. Non-GAAP net income was 10 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 28 cents. Quarterly revenues were $1.1 million, which missed the consensus estimate of $2 million. ASTS is transforming connectivity with direct-to-cell technology leveraging the first and only space-based cellular broadband network. It boasts a diverse portfolio of more than 3,400 patent and patent-pending claims worldwide for the direct-to-cell satellite ecosystem from space to Earth.The SpaceMobile service is compatible with all major brands available in the market and connects directly to everyday mobile phones. It is based on a novel technology that delivers broadband connectivity from space to unmodified mobile devices, providing a service to fill cellular coverage gaps in a differentiated approach compared to other space-based communication services. AST SpaceMobile has partnered with leading carriers such as AT&T Inc. T and Verizon Communications Inc. VZ to tap into a pre-existing pool of cell customers and avail funds to help build a worldwide satellite network. With AT&T, ASTS has entered into a definitive commercial agreement, extending until 2030, to offer a space-based direct-to-mobile technology to complement and integrate with the former’s mobile network. This approach aims to provide customers with connectivity in locations previously deemed unreachable, enhancing AT&T’s industry leadership in utilizing emerging satellite technologies.ASTS also collaborated with Verizon, wherein the latter made a $100 million commitment for satellite direct-to-cellular service for its customers. The two back-to-back deals sent ASTS’ stock price soaring. It further enhanced cellular coverage in the United States, essentially eliminating dead zones and empowering remote areas of the country with space-based connectivity. AST SpaceMobile has successfully sent its first five commercial satellites dubbed Bluebird in low Earth orbits, marking a key advancement in developing a space-based mobile network infrastructure. These satellites have the largest-ever commercial communications arrays spanning 693 square feet. They offer non-continuous service across the United States using more than 5,600 cells within the premium low-band spectrum.\\xa0This achievement follows the success of AST SpaceMobile's in-orbit BlueWalker 3 satellite. It marks significant progress in the company's mission to create a space-based cellular broadband network that directly links with mobile devices, eliminating the need for ground-based infrastructure. By expanding its connectivity to remote areas, the company aims to ensure that more people have access to vital communication services. ASTS has gained 439.8% over the past year compared with the industry’s growth of 39.7%. It has also outperformed its peers like Aviat Networks, Inc. AVNW and Comtech Telecommunications Corp. CMTL over this period. One-Year Price Performance Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AST SpaceMobile for 2024 and 2025 has narrowed 5.8% and 2%, respectively, to a loss of 97 cents per share and a loss of 50 cents over the past 30 days. The positive estimate revision depicts optimism about the stock’s growth potential. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research However, the company is currently valued at a premium compared to its industry on a forward 12-month P/S basis. From a valuation standpoint, AST SpaceMobile appears relatively expensive compared to the industry and above its mean. Going by the price/sales ratio, the company shares currently trade at 77.72 forward sales, higher than 5.47 for the industry and the stock’s mean of 24.63. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The collaboration with leading carriers is seen as a pathway to unlocking the potential of space-based cellular broadband, promising seamless, reliable service across the continental United States. The launch of the Bluebird satellites will likely transform network connectivity and help bridge the digital divide, significantly expanding its global presence and enhancing AST SpaceMobile’s capabilities in providing ubiquitous connectivity. The uptrend in estimate revisions further portrays bullish sentiments about the company’s business model.However, AST SpaceMobile is trading at a premium valuation.\\xa0Nevertheless, with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), ASTS appears primed for further stock price appreciation. Consequently, investors are likely to profit if they bet on this high-flying stock. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.

The restatements, which ADM said would be necessary when the accounting errors were announced, corrected figures for transactions within and between ADM’s businesses. The move by ADM follows an accounting scandal that has since January wiped out billions of dollars in market value and drawn investigations by the Department of Justice and Securities & Exchange Commission. ADM has replaced its chief financial officer, appointed AT&T Inc.’s top lawyer to its board and implemented new controls as part of efforts to restore credibility. ADM has identified and corrected sales between units that either were previously recorded at prices that didn’t approximate the market, or included transactions that were improperly classified. So-called intersegment sales for 2023 had been previously overestimated by $1.28 billion, according to Monday’s statement. Still, operating profits for each of ADM’s three units remained the same as previously reported. Shares of ADM were little changed in after-market trading Monday. The stock has lost 27% this year, which compares with a 9.6% decline for main rival Bunge Global SA.

T has gained 32.9% year to date compared with the industry’s rally of 30%. It has outperformed peers like Verizon Communications Inc. VZ but lagged T-Mobile US, Inc. TMUS.In the recently released third-quarter financial results, AT&T witnessed solid wireless traction and customer additions, partially offset by lower demand for legacy voice and data services. The company recorded strong subscriber growth backed by a resilient business model and robust cash flow position, driven by diligent execution of operational plans. AT&T expects to continue investing in key areas of 5G and fiber and adjust its business according to the evolving market scenario to fuel long-term growth. YTD Price Performance of T Image Source: Zacks Investment Research AT&T continues to enhance its network infrastructure, including 5G and fiber networks, to provide best-in-class coverage and capacity across the nation. The infrastructure investments position it for growth by ensuring widespread access to its services. AT&T's commitment to closing the digital divide underscores its dedication to fostering inclusive connectivity and driving socio-economic progress as the digital landscape evolves.\\xa0With a customer-centric business model, AT&T is likely to benefit from the increased deployment of mid-band spectrum and greater fiber densification. An integrated fiber expansion strategy is expected to improve broadband connectivity for enterprise and consumer markets, while steady 5G deployments are likely to boost end-user experience.For a seamless transition among Wi-Fi, Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and 5G services, AT&T intends to deploy a standards-based nationwide mobile 5G network. Its 5G service entails utilizing millimeter wave spectrum for deployment in dense pockets, while in suburban and rural areas, it intends to deploy 5G on mid- and low-band spectrum holdings.\\xa0The acquisition of mid-band spectrum (C-Band) further offers significant bandwidth with better propagation characteristics for optimum coverage in rural and urban areas. AT&T believes that as the 5G ecosystem evolves, customers can experience significant enhancements in coverage, speeds and devices. The company added 226,000 fiber customers in the third quarter of 2024 and remains on track to surpass 30 million fiber locations by the end of 2025. To augment operational efficiency and help build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers, AT&T intends to leverage Ericsson ERIC technology to deploy a commercial-scale open radio access network (Open RAN) across the country. The Open RAN architecture facilitates healthy competition among vendors for the supply of essential components and reduces dependence on a single manufacturer. It is likely to offer more flexibility, lower costs and monetize the network while thwarting security risks by avoiding reliance on non-U.S. vendors such as Huawei.AT&T aims to deploy Open RAN for 70% of its wireless network traffic across open-capable platforms by late 2026. The company expects to have fully integrated Open RAN sites operating in coordination with Ericsson from 2024, enabling it to move away from closed proprietary interfaces for rapid scaling and management of mixed supplier hardware at each cell site. From 2025, the company intends to scale this Open RAN environment throughout its wireless network in coordination with multiple suppliers to establish itself as the leading player in the industry. Despite solid wireless traction, earnings estimates for AT&T for 2024 have moved down 11.9% to $2.22 over the past year, while the same for 2025 has declined 10.5% to $2.31. The negative estimate revision depicts bearish sentiments for the stock. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research AT&T is facing a steady decline in legacy services. The company’s wireline division is struggling with persistent losses in access lines as a result of competitive pressure from voice-over-Internet protocol service providers and aggressive triple-play (voice, data, video) offerings by the cable companies. High-speed Internet revenues are contracting due to the legacy Digital Subscriber Line decline, simplified pricing and bundle discounts. As AT&T tries to woo customers with healthy discounts, freebies and cash credits, margin pressures tend to escalate, affecting its growth potential.AT&T has also offered a muted outlook for 2024 amid a challenging macroeconomic environment. For 2024, management expects adjusted earnings to be between $2.15 and $2.25 per share as high investments in infrastructure upgrades weigh on margins. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research By investing steadily in infrastructure and pioneering new technologies, AT&T is well-positioned to bridge the digital divide and enhance the connectivity landscape nationwide. This is likely to translate into solid postpaid subscriber growth and higher average revenue per user in the Mobility Service business.However, a saturated wireless market and price wars owing to competitive pressure have eroded its profitability. The downtrend in estimate revisions further portrays skepticism about the stock’s growth potential. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), AT&T appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

Dramatic shifts in geopolitical, financial, and trade policies are going to transform the market, with trillions of dollars at stake. And nowhere is the anxiety more acute than among strategic companies, with Trump’s victory poised to give a boost to big banks and send defense sector stocks soaring. Meanwhile, the tech industry is a mixed bag and the oil and gas industry is set to do well under Trump. While readers might expect Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to be among the biggest ‘Trump Trades’, the “Magnificent Seven” in general aren’t on our list. Our Top 3 picks are highly strategic and focused on the biggest elephant in the room: national security, defense, and heavy industry. #1 Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Trump’s spending policies are expected to inject significant momentum into the defense industry, starting first with key manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman. With a Trump victory, there will be a decidedly hawkish undertone to budget amounts for defense. With the Middle East threatening to explode into a wider regional conflict, with enough external actors to turn this into a world war, and with the Russia-Ukraine war still going strong and expanding into venues as far away as Africa, national defense has become a mainstream issue that captures voter sentiment more than it did the last time around. Lockheed Martin manufactures F-35 fighter aircraft, and it is already outperforming its peers and enjoying its share of the Pentagon’s recent $12-billion budget bonanza. In these times of geopolitical escalation, Lockheed is likely a buy under any president, but Trump could push it over the edge. #2 Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) Antimony is the “most important metal you’ve never heard of”, as Forbes has perfectly described it. It’s the national defense kingmaker, and Military Metals Corp. is uniquely positioned to supply what could be the most significant metal of our time. According to the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), antimony is a highly critical element for the defense industry. It’s necessary for armor-piercing ammunition, infrared sensors, bullets, precision optics, nuclear weapons, semiconductors, cables, and batteries. Antimony prices exploded this year, rising well over 200% after Beijing slapped export restrictions on antimony, with the explicit intention of restricting global shipments to shore up China’s own natural security. This move has sent shockwaves through the tech and defense industries. Antimony is currently trading at over $35,000 a ton. The few companies active in the space have seen their share prices jump. Larvotta Resources, an Australian miner saw its share price explode 800% as China moved to restrict antimony exports, while Perpetua Resources, a Pentagon-backed miner saw its share price jump by more than 200% since the beginning of this year. Despite the major jump in antimony prices there are very few pure antimony plays in the market, but Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) stands out as a bold contender, aggressively building a portfolio of some of the most prolific, past-producing assets in Europe and North America. This ambitious explorer isn’t just gathering properties; it’s strategically seizing high-grade antimony and gold projects with historical impact such as the historical West Gore antimony mine, which was England’s largest supplier during World War I. Across the ocean in Europe, the company recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia. But the best thing here is the quality of the assets. Where development stage competitor Perpetua will mine antimony as a by-product at 0.06% per ton, the Slovakian properties of Military Metals Corp. easily reach up to 4% per ton of ore. According to Military Metals Corp. CEO Scott Eldridge, its assets are in the top three out of 15 companies globally in terms of quality of the assets. Confirming its reputation as a fast-mover,\\xa0 Military Metals Corp. announced the acquisition of another 388 hectares\\xa0 at its Nova Scotia West Gore project and has now “gained complete coverage over the entire mineralized system including all the historical mine workings and known antimony-gold occurrences”. Already earlier this month it made another acquisition, this time in Europe, where governments are just about as anxious about its future antimony supply as the United States. On October 7, 2024, Military Metals Corp. pushed onward with its rapid advance on antimony assets with an agreement to scoop up 100% ownership in a private company that owns two antimony projects in Slovakia, including a third tin asset. The Trojarova Antimony Project, Tienesgrund Antimony Project and the Medvedi Tin Project all have Soviet-era resources. The Trojarova project is one of the European’s Union’s largest historical Antimony resources. Source: Military Metals Corp. \"This acquisition strategically positions Military Metals as a leading explorer and developer of antimony,\" said CEO Scott Eldridge. \"The Trojarova and Tienesgrund projects offer significant potential for rapid advancement, particularly given Slovakia\\'s strong mining infrastructure and history. We see this as a perfect alignment with the European Union\\'s Critical Raw Materials Act, opening the door to potential EU funding sources as we advance these projects toward production.\" The company is rushing the antimony playing field here, moving at breakneck speed to acquire critical assets at the same time that China is tightening the reins on the rarest components of its national defense machine. With wildly escalating geopolitical tensions, coupled with Western sanctions on Russian metals, what makes it a ‘Trump Trade’ is the added impact a renewed tariff war would have on American antimony supplies if China decides to fight back. Speculative demand is at an all-time high, even as China grapples with a downturn in demand since it implemented export restrictions. With every hostile move from Beijing, we could expect antimony prices to rise further, creating significantly higher value for junior explorers and producers who have swooped in to take advantage of this national defense opportunity. #3 Nucor (NYSE:NUE) Back in August 2021, under Trump’s tenure, steel (HRC) was fetching around $2000 per ounce. Those days are gone. Today, it’s trading in the low $700s, and American steel producers need a lifeline for slowing sales and faltering growth. Trump could be that lifeline, and Nucor looks nicely positioned to reap the benefits. The American producer suffered this year, with revenue for the six months ended June 29 shedding 11% compared to the same period in 2023. Earnings per share have also taken a beating, down 40% from Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023. And Q3 earnings are expected to be worse, making this a good time to get in on the steel sector before it truly becomes a ‘Trump Trade’. There is a clear growth pathway here for Nucor, which is planning to invest $6.5 billion in eight major projects through 2027, but Trump policies would help bring the stock back up with the growth potential. A Trump promise of 10% tariffs on all important producers could reduce price competition pressure for Nucor, particularly emanating from producers based in China and Brazil. \"While market conditions have softened compared to recent record-setting years, Nucor remains focused on its long-term growth strategy and has returned more than $1.7 billion to investors through June,\" Nucor CEO Leon Topalian said in a second-quarter earnings release.

There are two kinds of companies producing America\\'s defense technology today. There are the “primes” — well-established defense giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), RTX (RTX), and Northrop Grumman (NOC) — and there are the high-profile and fast-moving startups such as Anduril, which boasts 4,000 employees and a valuation of $14 billion only seven years after its founding. Investors are enthusiastic about this sector. Between 2021 and mid-June of this year, venture capitalists invested $130 billion in defense tech startups, according to PitchBook. How might a second Trump administration impact this industry? Schimpf said there is an opportunity for the Defense Department to reimagine how it procures military systems going forward. “Our view of this is let’s do what literally every free-market system has done,” he said. “Let’s just have the DOD be a better buyer. Buy the best tech. Show the entrepreneurs that if you build technology that actually works, that solves a real problem, we will actually buy it. And you have a chance to actually succeed doing that at scale.” This view echoes a post made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk (TSLA), who has closely aligned himself with Trump in recent months, on social platform X. Musk responded to Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, saying it is “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” referencing the US Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. Schimpf’s company is built to capitalize on a belief that the future of war will be defined by relatively low-cost autonomous systems and not by high-cost, low-quantity fighter planes and aircraft carriers. Anduril has built a portfolio of such products, including counter-drone aircraft, autonomous submarines, and an autonomous security tower deployed on US military bases. Christopher Kirchhoff, who founded the Pentagon’s Silicon Valley office, told Yahoo Finance there is broad agreement inside the Pentagon that more resources should be shifted to the American defense tech community. However, there are political challenges. Kirchhoff noted that the Defense secretary would require strong allies inside the White House and on Capitol Hill to push forward meaningful change. “If you look at the amount of authority the [secretary of Defense] has, it’s actually very small,” Kirchhoff said. “Will the president actually exert leadership? Will Congress be receptive? It takes more than just the secretary to change the department.” Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks Read the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance'}\n",

Work is being conducted as part of a larger effort under the Department of Defense\\'s Operational Energy Strategy. Under the contract, Raytheon\\'s Advanced Technology team will develop advanced wireless power transmitter and receiver technologies to enable a long-range demonstration in line with the needs of U.S. Army manned and unmanned system requirements. \"Wireless power and data can provide enhanced capability in the future manned and unmanned teaming battlespace,\" said Colin Whelan, president of Advanced Technology at Raytheon. \"This is extremely important in highly contested threat environments where operations are challenged.\" Wireless power beaming reduces the need for troops to carry additional fuel and batteries, easing their logistics, increasing their operation time, and safeguarding their locations. In addition, wireless power enables energy uniformity in the battlespace allowing ease of capture and delivery of energy to sensor systems without the need for concentrated fuel depots that could be vulnerable. Raytheon has a long history in wireless power transmission dating back to the 1960s with William Brown pioneering the first demonstration that still holds the record for the highest energy transfer and the longest range independently. In recent years, the company has been focused on developing state of the art technologies to enable wireless power across long ranges and incorporate them in systems of the future.

These swings can quickly impact analysts’ ratings for a stock; within months, weeks, or even days, a “Buy” recommendation might shift to a “Hold” and vice versa. RTX Corporation (RTX), a leading aerospace and defense contractor, exemplifies this market volatility, having rallied 49% so far in 2024. Even if a stock starts from a point of substantial undervaluation, as I believe was the case for RTX, this rally appears to have overextended its share price. Therefore, I believe it is too late to buy the stock, and I am initiating coverage with a Hold rating. RTX’s third-quarter earnings results, released on October 22, were undoubtedly strong, which is one reason I’m bullish on them operationally but not overall (more on that to come in my discussion of the valuation). The company’s sales climbed 6% year-over-year to $20.1 billion for the quarter, exceeding the analyst consensus by $300 million. This growth was led by a double-digit topline increase in the Pratt & Whitney segment, driven by higher aftermarket demand and a greater mix of higher-priced, larger commercial engines. RTX’s adjusted diluted EPS rose 16% over the year-ago period to $1.45 in the third quarter, beating the analyst consensus by $0.11. Additionally, RTX’s non-GAAP net profit margin improved by nearly 10 basis points to 9.7% during the quarter. Coupled with a 7% decline in the average diluted share count due to share repurchases, this is how adjusted diluted EPS growth outpaced sales growth in the quarter. Another reason I like RTX’s fundamentals is its phenomenal backlog. As of September 30, the company ended the third quarter with a record backlog of $221 billion, equivalent to nearly three years of revenue at the current pace. For context, this represents a significant increase from the $206 billion backlog as of June 30. Strong new Defense orders ($25 billion) and Commercial orders ($11 billion) resulted in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.8 for the quarter. Defense orders for the quarter included $1.9 billion in Lower Tier Air Missile Defense Systems and a $1.3 billion contract at Pratt for continued development of the F-135 engine core upgrade program. On the Commercial side, Collins was awarded a $470 million contract by the Federal Aviation Administration for continued technical refresh and enhancement of its air traffic control automation system. These were just a few of the new contracts contributing to the substantial uptick in the backlog during the quarter. As a result of RTX’s growing backlog, the analyst outlook for the company is positive. Adjusted diluted EPS is expected to rise by 10.1% in 2024 to $5.57. Beyond this year, another 9% increase in adjusted diluted EPS to $6.07 is projected for 2025. By 2026, an additional 14.1% surge in adjusted diluted EPS to $6.93 is anticipated. RTX’s dividend is yet another reason that I am glad to own the stock. Its 2% dividend yield is moderately greater than the 1.2% yield of the S&P 500 index (SPX). The company’s payout ratio is also set to be in the mid 40% range for 2024, which positions it for dividend growth about as fast as earnings growth. That’s why I’m confident the dividend can keep compounding at a high-single-digit rate annually for the foreseeable future. RTX’s balance sheet is a characteristic that I also appreciate. The company’s interest coverage ratio through the first nine months of 2024 was 4. The debt-to-capital ratio in the high 30% range is another element that suggests the company’s capitalization is manageable. This is why S&P Global (SPGI) awards a BBB+ credit rating to RTX. As I alluded to at the outset, RTX is a fundamentally strong business. The only factor holding me back from an overall bullish sentiment is the stock’s valuation. RTX’s current-year P/E ratio of 22.2x is higher than its 10-year average of 18x. Even the forward P/E ratio of 20.4x indicates that the stock is fully valued. This is because RTX’s forward growth prospects are similar to the growth that it delivered in the past. That’s why I would contend the fair value multiple should still be around 18x. Shifting to Wall Street, analysts have a Moderate Buy rating consensus on RTX. Among 15 analysts, six have issued Buy ratings and nine have assigned Hold ratings in the past three months. The average 12-month RTX price target of $132.47 equates to a 7.22% upside from current price levels. See more RTX analyst ratings RTX is a business firing on all cylinders. The company’s backlog has never been stronger. The dividend is easily covered and has room to fly higher. RTX’s corporate credit rating is firmly investment-grade. Until the stock either experiences a correction and/or earnings estimates move higher, I’m starting coverage with a neutral rating. Disclosure'}\n",

And finally, our EPS guidance does not include any charges or gains that would be reported as non-GAAP adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. With that, let's head into the studio and hear about the quarter. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Hello, everyone, and thanks for tuning in today. Our momentum is building as we keep executing on our commitments, delivering yet another quarter of strong results that came in ahead of expectations and another guidance raise. This makes it eight quarters in a row now of solid mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. And we translated that 5% organic top-line growth into 8% EPS growth on a constant currency basis, and we remain on track to deliver high single-digit EPS growth on a reported basis in the back half of the fiscal year. We know that innovation matters and innovation is what really is driving our growth today across multiple areas. We're seeing strong performance from franchises like TAVR, PFA, leadless pacemakers, diabetes, spine, and neuromodulation, just to name a few. And we're confident that this diversified growth will keep going, especially with the strength of our pipeline in high-impact markets like hypertension, which is a big, exciting opportunity for us. If you look at our recent performance, it's clear, the foundation of the company is much stronger. We've integrated a real performance mindset, alongside our mission-driven culture, and it's making a difference. And as we continue to drive durable top-line growth, use our scale to deliver leveraged earnings, generate strong free cash flow, pursue smart tuck-in M&A, and grow our dividend, we're setting ourselves up to create strong long-term returns for our shareholders. Now, let's turn to the details of our Q2 business results and discuss our performance. Looking first at our highest growth businesses, combined, they grew 8% again this quarter and made up 20% of our revenue. Starting with structural heart. We grew high single digits on the strength of our TAVR franchise. In the U.S., we launched Evolut FX+, and we're seeing strong customer adoption. We also received CE Mark for FX+ last month and began commercializing in Europe last week. FX+ is important not only for the lifetime management benefit it offers, but also because it creates an additional opportunity for us to reiterate our positive SMART trial results. Now, you'll recall that SMART demonstrated our superior valve performance in small annulus patients, who are primarily women, and they make up about 40% of the TAVR segment. With this combination of FX+; low-risk data; and now, SMART data, we expect to continue to grow at or above market in the quarters ahead. Next, in cardiac ablation solutions, our technology is helping to drive the rapid shift of the market to pulse field ablation. We've been significantly expanding our manufacturing capacity to meet this growing demand, and we're well-positioned as the only company with both single-shot and focal PFA catheters. We continue to drive our growth of our PulseSelect PFA single-shot catheter. This is offsetting cryoablation declines, and our rate of cryo sequential decline significantly improved versus what we saw in Q1. With PFA this quarter, we nearly doubled the number of physicians using PulseSelect and we more than doubled the total number of patients treated with this catheter in Q2. That said, our overall CAS growth did not accelerate as expected this quarter due to a third-party component supplier interruption. They've now expanded capacity, allowing us to continue to ramp PulseSelect availability and activate new accounts. On top of PulseSelect, we were pleased to receive FDA approval late last month for our Affera Mapping and Ablation System and Sphere-9 focal catheter. This all-in-one catheter was designed from the ground up to perform high-density mapping, as well as pulse field and RF ablations. Sphere-9 replaces competitors' mapping and RF catheters, allowing us to increase our revenue per case. We're ramping commercial availability now, having already entered some of the top U.S. centers by volume, and this will accelerate over the coming weeks and quarters to meet the significant demand. And we continue to rapidly hire mapping specialists in advance of entering new centers, giving us confidence in our ability to accelerate account activations. With the strong customer response to the breadth of our new PFA portfolio, we expect our overall CAS growth rate to accelerate through the back half of the fiscal year, including strong double-digit growth in Q3, and we expect to reach and then exceed market growth in this large and fast-growing $9 billion cardiac ablation space. Next, in surgical robotics, we continue to invest in our Hugo platform, building a strong foundation for future growth. In the U.S., we've completed capturing the necessary data for our urology submission and expect to file with the FDA in the first quarter of calendar '25. We're also seeing fast enrollment in our next two U.S. indication studies, hernia and gynecology. In digital, we commenced commercial rollout of our Touch Surgery livestream remote connectivity solution across the U.S. and Western Europe as we continue to digitize operating rooms globally. And we're making progress bringing our advanced surgical technologies to Hugo. We expect ICG fluorescent imaging to be available in certain countries soon, followed by adding our market-leading LigaSure vessel-sealing technology to Hugo next calendar year. Next, in diabetes, we delivered another quarter of double-digit growth, growing 11% despite more difficult comparisons from the 780G U.S. launch last year. Our CGM sales grew over 20% in both the U.S. and international markets, driven by the high CGM attachment rates to the 780G. In addition, our Simplera Sync sensor, which is half the size and much easier to apply than our previous sensor, is gaining strong acceptance in international markets. On the Smart MDI front, we just secured FDA clearance for our InPen app, which paves the way for a limited U.S. release of our Smart MDI system with our Simplera CGM. So, we continue to add new patients with the 780G system. The majority are coming from MDI. And we're also seeing success from our competitive switch programs. Patients are attracted to 780G's highest time in range of any commercial AID system and achieving this control with less burden. In the dQ&A survey of over 1,500 AID users in the U.S., the 780G had the highest user satisfaction of any AID system, including scoring 20 percentage points higher than the Tandem-Dexcom combination and 25 points higher than the insulin-Dexcom combination. We're investing heavily in diabetes to expand manufacturing capacity and advance our robust technology pipeline, including our partnership with Abbott on an integrated sensor. These activities support our strategy to be No. 1 in the fast-growing AID and Smart MDI space, with a technology ecosystem that is focused on achieving better control with less burden. Now, turning to hypertension and the large future growth opportunity of our Symplicity blood pressure procedure. With a proven track record of long-term efficacy and safety and unique design, this innovative solution is poised to transform hypertension management. We're pleased that CMS earlier this month finalized the outpatient transitional pass-through payment, which will take effect on January 1st. With coding and sufficient Medicare payment now in place, the key step for broader adoption is to establish standardized coverage. On this front, we continue to engage with CMS to facilitate access for patients to this important therapy. And we're working with private payers to advance coverage as well. Hypertension is a global health challenge and the leading cause of cardiovascular disease and premature death worldwide. In fact, it impacts more than 1 billion people globally, including nearly half of all U.S. adults. Despite the availability of numerous medications, only 1 in 4 adults with hypertension in the U.S. have it under control. And the direct cost to the U.S. healthcare system for hypertension are massive, somewhere between $100 billion and $200 billion a year. So, our Symplicity procedure can play a very important role in cost-effectively improving public health. Now, looking at our established market leaders. Combined, they made up nearly half of our revenue and grew mid-single digits. In many cases, we've innovated on the technology and business models to reinvent these businesses over the past few years, and we continue to invest in them to ensure durable growth. They are a key part of our financial model, helping us to consistently deliver on the top line, and they contribute a disproportionate amount of profit and cash flow. In cranial and spinal technologies, we grew 6% worldwide, including 7% growth in U.S. core spine and biologics. In a market that rewards scale, we're continuing to win. This is driven by our leading AiBLE ecosystem of differentiated spine implants and enabling technologies, Including AI-driven pre-op planning software, imaging, robotics, navigation, and powered surgical instruments. Our large global AiBLE installed base is changing the competitive dynamics in spine. And we continue to expand its features and its capabilities. At the NAS conference in September, we announced a new partnership with Siemens Healthineers to co-market and integrate their imaging technologies for spine care. We expect CST to continue to deliver sustained above-market growth, with AiBLE and its differentiated best-in-class solutions attracting not only spine surgeons around the world, but also the best sales reps and distributors who continue to leave the competition to join our winning team. Next, in surgical, we had flat results. As I mentioned last quarter, we had difficult year-over-year comparisons given the supply recovery last year, as well as the Korean market slowdown from the ongoing physician strikes. It's worth noting that, on a sequential basis, surgical had strong high single-digit growth, both globally and in the U.S. We had outsized strength in advanced energy, driven by accelerated adoption of our LigaSure XP Maryland vessel sealer. Overall, we continue to expect surgical to return to more normalized growth starting next quarter as these comparisons ease. In cardiac rhythm management, we had another strong quarter, growing in the mid-single digits, including high single-digit growth in both defibrillation solutions and in cardiac pacing therapies. Our Micra leadless pacemaker franchise grew high teens, with broad strength around the world. Now, turning to our synergistic businesses, which collectively grew mid-single digits and represented over 30% of our revenue. The highlight again this quarter was neuromodulation, where growth accelerated to 12% and the business continues to grow well above the market. We're seeing broad-based growth across product lines, including pain stim and brain modulation. In pain stim, we grew 10%, including 12% growth in the U.S. on the continued launch of the Inceptiv closed-loop spinal cord stimulator. The innovation in Inceptiv is transforming the treatment of chronic pain for patients. It automatically keeps therapy at the optimal dose and allows patients to focus on everyday life, not on managing their chronic pain. In addition, it has the best full-body MRI conditional access on the market, and the competition really isn't even close. This is important given that over 80% of these patients need an MRI within five years and nearly all of them need one within 10 years. In brain modulation, growth accelerated to 17%, the third quarter in a row of double-digit growth. This innovation-driven growth is built on the ongoing launch of our Percept RC with BrainSense technology. Percept is having a huge impact for patients with movement disorders like Parkinson's, essential tremor, dystonia, and epilepsy. It not only delivers therapy to specific brain targets, but it is the only DBS system that captures and records brain signals. Now, this equips physicians with valuable data and the insights needed to personalize the therapy. And just like in pain stim, our DBS devices have differentiated MRI advantages versus the competition. In addition to neuromod, we also had strong performances in other synergistic businesses. Cardiac surgery grew 10%, with the broad strength coming from innovative products like our Avalus Ultra surgical valve, Penditure LAA exclusion system, and VitalFlow ECMO system. Acute care and monitoring grew 3%, including 9% in Nellcor pulse oximetry. And pelvic health accelerated its growth to 5%. Now, with that, let's go to Gary, who will give you a deeper look at our Q2 financial performances and our outlook. Gary, over to you. Gary Corona -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Geoff. We delivered a strong top-line performance again this quarter with revenue growth of 5%, 50 basis points above our guidance. On the bottom line, adjusted EPS was $1.26, a penny above the midpoint of our guidance. We continue to invest in our pipeline and behind our emerging growth drivers while also delivering bottom-line growth, which was up 8% on a constant currency basis. The EPS beat was driven by $0.02 from greater operating profit on the revenue beat, partially offset by $0.01 from tax. The sources of our revenue growth continue to be diversified, both by business and geography, which gives us confidence in its durability. From a segment perspective, we had double-digit growth in diabetes, high single-digit growth in neuroscience, and mid-single-digit growth in cardiovascular. The low single-digit growth in our medical surgical portfolio was expected given the comparisons in surgical that Geoff addressed. It's worth noting that med surg grew 7% sequentially, and we expect to return to more normalized year-over-year growth starting next quarter. From a geographic perspective, our international markets grew revenue high single digits, including mid-single-digit growth in Western Europe and Japan and low double-digit growth in emerging markets. Moving down the P&L. Our adjusted gross margin was 65.2%, down 70 basis points but in line with our expectations. The decline was entirely driven by foreign currency as our adjusted gross margin was up 40 basis points on a constant currency basis. Our adjusted operating margin was 24.3%, also in line with our expectations. The 90-basis-point year-over-year decline was entirely driven by FX. On a constant currency basis, operating margins increased 100 basis points. The organization remains extremely focused on improving our margins. We're more than doubling our underlying productivity in the COGS line through centralizing operations, consolidating factories and suppliers, and driving the Medtronic performance system across our manufacturing network. We're also laser-focused on pricing discipline and optimization, particularly behind our new innovation. At the same time, we're very early in a number of new product launches that aren't fully at scale, including Affera, Simplera, and Hugo, which can create a mix headwind for us. That said, on the SG&A line, we're focused on growing at less than sales, like we did again this quarter, as we drive efficiency and productivity gains, particularly in our back-office functions. Given all the levers we have, we have line of sight to improving our margins over time while continuing to prioritize and make significant investments in our organic pipeline and product launches. Now, regarding capital allocation, we continue to make choices and invest to drive future profitable growth while also returning capital to shareholders, primarily through our dividend and, from time to time, opportunistic share repurchases. As I mentioned last quarter, we've increased our focus on tuck-in M&A. We're also continuing to work to evaluate our portfolio. Overall, we view active portfolio management as an important lever to delivering on our long-term strategic and financial objectives. Now, turning to guidance. Given our continued outperformance and positive momentum, we're raising our full year revenue and EPS guidance. We now expect fiscal '25 organic revenue growth of 4.75% to 5%, an increase from the prior range of 4.5% to 5%. For Q3, we're expecting to deliver another quarter of mid-single-digit growth on the top line, and we'd have you model organic revenue growth of approximately 4.75%. Based on recent rates, FX would have an unfavorable impact to fiscal '25 in the range of $225 million to $325 million, including a $100 million to $150 million in the third quarter. Moving down the P&L. We expect our third and fourth quarter gross margins to improve sequentially as currency becomes much less of an impact. We also continue to expect our full year operating margins to expand as we balance driving efficiencies with investing behind our product launches and in our long-term pipeline. On the bottom line, we're raising our fiscal '25 non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance to a new range of $5.44 to $5.50, an increase from the prior range of $5.42 to $5.50. For the third quarter, we expect EPS of $1.35 to $1.37. The fiscal year '25 guidance range continues to include an unfavorable 5% impact from foreign currency, including an unfavorable 1% impact in Q3. Further details on our annual guidance can be found in the guidance slide in our presentation. So, to conclude, we remain focused on restoring our earnings power, having just delivered another quarter of leveraged EPS growth on a constant currency basis. We continue to expect to report high single-digit adjusted EPS growth in the back half of our fiscal year, in line with our long-term commitment to deliver durable mid-single-digit organic revenue growth with EPS leverage. Geoff, back to you. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Thank you, Gary. Now, before we go to analyst questions, I want to close with a few thoughts. We're delivering durable mid-single-digit revenue growth, which we've been doing consistently now for two years. This is the direct result of all the changes we've made to the company over the past few years, from the resiliency of our operations and supply chain to our performance incentive plans, to our culture and our people. We've also been investing to position ourselves in high-growth markets, and this has led to a wave of recent product approvals across many of our businesses. Look, it's exciting, and it creates a tailwind that this company hasn't had in a while. We've been working hard to put ourselves in a position to win, with revenue growth tailwinds on top of a strong foundation. And now, it's up to us -- it's just up to us to execute and deliver on these opportunities. And then as we go down the P&L, the significant work that we've been implementing to drive cost savings and earnings power will start to show up in our reported results in the back half of this fiscal year. And when our organization delivers strong earnings, we translate this into strong free cash flow. This creates a virtuous cycle, with incremental firepower for investment and returning capital to our shareholders. And when you combine all of this with the work that we've been doing with portfolio management, we expect to deliver significant long-term value for our shareholders. Finally, I want to thank all of our employees around the world. I know many of you are watching today, and it's because of your efforts and those that came before you that Medtronic has accomplished so much in the 75 years since this company was founded. Your work directly benefits the lives of over 78 million people this year. That's an incredible accomplishment. And when I think about the work you're doing to create our future, the innovations that you're inventing, engineering, manufacturing, and preparing to sell, this work has the potential to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life for hundreds of millions of people and create tremendous value for many other stakeholders. Thank you for everything that you do. With that, let's move to Q&A, where we're going to try to get to as many analysts as possible. So, we ask that you limit yourself to just one question and, only if needed, a related follow-up. If you have additional questions, you can reach out to Ryan and the investor relations team after the call. With that, Brad, can you please give the instructions for asking a question? Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations [Operator instructions] Lastly, please be advised that this Q&A session is being recorded. For today's session, Geoff, Gary, and Ryan are joined by Que Dallara, EVP and president of diabetes; Mike Marinaro, EVP and president of the medical surgical portfolio; Sean Salmon, EVP and president of the cardiovascular portfolio; and Brett Wall, EVP and president of the neuroscience portfolio. We'll pause for a few seconds to assemble the queue. All right. We'll take the first question from Larry Biegelsen at Wells Fargo. Larry, please go ahead. Larry Biegelsen -- Analyst Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on a nice quarter here. You know, I heard you guys talk about the hypertension opportunity a few times on this call. I think we saw a video before the call highlighting renal denervation. So, I wanted to ask Sean about that. Sean, you have the TPT for RDN beginning in January. How much of a benefit are you expecting from that and when are you anticipating the national coverage decision? And, you know, are you planning to use the new TSAT process for that? And, Sean, I think it's been a while since we've heard you talk about just kind of your overall thoughts on the renal denervation opportunity. Thanks for taking the question. Sean Salmon -- Executive Vice President and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio OK. Thanks, Larry. I appreciate the question. Look, we continue to make really great progress on the reimbursement front, as you mentioned, the TPT or the outpatient coverage for devices. And what that really addresses is a portion of the patients in Medicare. Roughly half of the Medicare patient population, those on fee-for-service would now be covered with this transitional pass-through payment, which is certainly going to be an accelerator for the therapy. But as you noted, getting broader coverage will get us out of the sort of the prior authorization loop, allowing you to just build to the codes that have already been established. So, making that headway is important. We also have to go further with the private payer universe. That does take longer. You go payer by payer, state by state. In terms of the efforts on coverage, what we're doing is going for coverage with evidence development. There are numerous pathways for that, and we'll be giving an update on that in the future. But I've got no incremental update today. Larry Biegelsen -- Analyst All right. Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations Thanks, Larry. We'll take the next question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations The next question comes from Robbie Marcus at J.P. Morgan. Robbie, please go ahead. Are you there, Robbie? Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations We can come back. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations We'll come back. The next question comes from Travis Steed at Bank of America. Travis, please go ahead. Travis Steed -- Analyst Hey. Thanks for taking the question. I guess I wanted to just talk about your -- kind of your ability to grow earnings high single digits, you know, longer term despite, you know, maybe some potential for -- you've got maybe a stronger dollar, tariff potential, and it sounds like some of the initial Affera/RDN launches could be negative on margins initially. But is there enough upside on some of those programs to offset potential headwinds? You know, is there potential cushion on some of the COGS productivity? I just kind of want to know your flexibility and your commitment to continue to grow earnings despite some of those potential headwinds that investors have been starting to worry about. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Travis, thanks for the question. And yeah, we are definitely committed to the earnings. I'll let Gary walk you through some of your -- the specifics of your questions. Gary Corona -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Thanks, Geoff. You know, we're pleased to raise our guidance on both revenue and EPS for the year as we continue to move -- build momentum. There's a lot to be excited about. And we're focused on driving durable, both revenue growth, as well as restoring the earnings power of the company. On the margin front, you know, what I want you to hear from us is there's no change to our margin expectations. In Q3, we expect margins of 25.6%, up 30 basis points year over year. Full year, we expect operating margins to be 25.7%, both -- up year over year by 10 basis points. You know, gross margins will be up sequentially in both Q3 and Q4, and that'll deliver our guidance. You know, on the SG&A front, we'll drive leverage through a focus on our highest priorities, leveraging what we've talked about before, automation and digitization. You know, we'll make some structural changes and we have strong discipline on our discretionary expenses to help drive that margin expansion. You know, you mentioned the early launches, and we're committed to investing behind those, both commercially and in R&D. So, taken together, that mid-single-digit revenue growth will deliver upwards of 10% EPS on a constant currency basis. You mentioned the foreign exchange. That'll be a 5-point headwind, in line with what we've talked about before. And that'll get us to the $5.44 to $5.50 guidance that we gave today. So, overall, we feel good. And worth mentioning, once that guidance is up, that sets us up for success. Travis Steed -- Analyst Great. Thanks a lot. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations Thanks, Travis. Next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations Yeah. Robbie, we'll go back to you if you're on. Otherwise, we'll move on. Robbie Marcus -- Analyst Yes. Can you hear me this time? Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations Yup. Thanks, Robbie. Robbie Marcus -- Analyst Great. Sorry about that. Forgot to unmute before. So, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask kind of as a counter to Travis' question some of the products you mentioned that were important growth drivers on sales but early in their life cycle on margin expansion: renal denervation, both PulseSelect, which had the supplier issue this quarter, and the upcoming or ongoing Sphere-9 Affera launch; and Hugo robotic; and renal denervation. Maybe you could just talk about, especially over the next six to 12 months as some of these products start to launch and progressively launch, how you're thinking about the cadence of growth for them and then also the margin implications as we think about some of these lower-margin products maybe adding some of the most incremental growth. Thanks a lot. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks, Robbie. Thanks for the question. Yeah. I mean, look, on the margin side, obviously, you're asking a question around mix. That's a piece of it. You know, but in addition to that, the pricing is -- continues to be an opportunity for us. I think that's been a positive here over the last couple of quarters, and I think there's more upside for us there in pricing and in our cost. You know, cost-down programs are -- have kicked in and are helping as well. So, those are, you know, I think, both tailwinds for us. On the mix side, it is a bit of a mixed bag. And I'll let Gary give you some details, but, you know, some of the programs like Hugo and Affera that involve, you know, capital can be a little -- can be lower, especially earlier in the cycle as you're ramping them up. But then we have some others like, you know, RDN and neuromod, which are -- you know, our neuromods out there now are having a pretty big positive impact on price and -- or on our margins and our mix. And RDN would do the same. I don't know if you -- how you want to add to that, Gary. Gary Corona -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah, not much to add, Geoff. I would just say, you know, first of all, all of the -- all of this is contemplated in our guidance. And for '25, we're expecting gross margins to be flat on a constant currency, with foreign exchange driving about 0.5 point of headwind. I talked about the sequential improvement that we expect in both Q3 and Q4 and our focus on stabilizing and improving from there. Geoff talked about some of the headwinds. But I'll also say, we're really laser-focused on cost reduction, on price, especially behind our innovation across the board, to fund the investment to ensure commercial success of these critical launches. Robbie Marcus -- Analyst Thank you very much. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations Thanks, Robbie. Next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations The next question comes from Vijay Kumar at Evercore ISI. Vijay, please go ahead. Vijay Kumar -- Analyst Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a steady execution here. Geoff, maybe I wanted to focus on ablation here. You know, you mentioned flattish growth in the quarter due to some disruption. What was the issue? When was it resolved? What gives us the confidence of strong double-digit growth in third quarter? Is that some revenue catch-up from second quarter? You know, when do you think cryo could bottom out? Is that in third quarter? And you did -- I thought it was interesting. You mentioned the revenue per case in Affera. Is that a 3X increase now versus cryo? Thank you. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. So, you know, as I said in the commentary, CAS in our ablation business didn't accelerate as we expected this quarter because of this third-party component supplier that experienced the -- an interruption in their supply test. That supplier is back on track. That issue is resolved. They've expanded their capacity as well and -- which is allowing us to ramp the PulseSelect supply and activate new accounts. PulseSelect is doing well. I mean, it's a -- it's in a good spot from a supply perspective going forward. Like, we literally sold [Audio gap] unit we had in Q2. And as I mentioned, we did double the -- you know, or close to double the physicians using PulseSelect, and we now have confidence to open more accounts. So, that should continue. And then we more than doubled the number of procedures, number of patients treated. And our -- as for cryo, the declines actually got better sequentially. And so, cryo wasn't the issue or -- you know, Q2 versus -- I'm sorry, Q1 versus Q2, though, because in Q2, those declines got better than Q1. And so, it really was the supply issue that's been resolved. So, you know, we now have -- we expect PulseSelect to continue to ramp. We have this -- and now, we have Sphere-9. And that's -- and that gives us -- all this combined, you know, the supplier issue being resolved and what we're seeing on PulseSelect demand and Affera demand, that gives us the confidence in the strong double-digit growth in Q3. So, this is an important area for us. It's an area of focus, and we feel like we're well-positioned with both, you know, the single shot and the only player with single shot and focal going forward. Vijay Kumar -- Analyst And sorry, the revenue per case on Affera, is that 3x versus cryo? Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Sean, do you want to handle that one, the revenue per case on Affera? Sean Salmon -- Executive Vice President and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio Yeah. So, Vijay, when you do cryo, it was really just balloon catheter that you're using. And when you're doing thermal ablation with RF or non-thermal with PFA, there's additional components that can be used, including like a mapping catheter, the patches that you use for navigation system. So, the case revenue goes up. And there's also, you know, the use of other technologies like crossing needles that we sell as well. So, the revenue per case does go up. I don't think it's 3x quite, but it's certainly more. And to correlate those two is with the Sphere-9 catheter, since you don't need a dedicated mapping catheter, it actually saves [Audio gap] money per case for the hospital. So, it's -- you know, the value proposition of having one catheter that can do the entire job with a single stick across transseptal is really appealing to physicians. Vijay Kumar -- Analyst Thank you, guys. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Better workflow for them. And, you know, even though as excited as hospitals are about PFA, they are still conscious on the price. And so, the fact that if you could save them the catheters, like Sean just mentioned, that helps. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations Thanks, Vijay. We'll go to the next question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations The next question comes from Shagun Singh at RBC Capital Markets. Shagun, please go ahead. Shagun Singh -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. Geoff, I was wondering if you could share your thoughts on the medtech landscape under the Trump administration? You know, specifically, what are your thoughts on tariffs? You know, how do you plan to navigate your supply chain? And perhaps you can, you know, touch on your exposure to imports from China. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Well, first, you know, before I jump into the election questions, I -- the medtech landscape, the underlying market is healthy. You know, we're seeing good procedure growth, and we think that's steady going forward, really driven by, you know, innovation, you know, whether it be the growth of minimally invasive procedures like TAVR or, you know, innovation in pacing like leadless and conduction system pacing or the -- we just -- the PFA conversation we just added that's, you know, pulling patients from a drug solution to a medtech solution. All these things are -- this innovation is what's driving a lot of this growth, plus just demographics. So, I think it's a healthy market. And under any administration, if you go back, you know, decades, whether it be in the U.S. or other countries, healthcare is an important priority for any government. And so, we feel good in that way. When you come to the specific, you know, election, I do think it's -- with the President-elect Trump coming in, I do think it's still a bit early to speculate about, you know, different policies, whether it be healthcare policy or exactly what's going to happen or not going to happen to tariffs. It's -- like I said, it's still too early. We're running different scenarios here, obviously, and preparing for different scenarios. But I don't want to get into that speculation. In terms of, though, our exposure to importing products from China, it's small. It's less than 1% of our revenue. Shagun Singh -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations Thanks, Shagun. We'll go to the next question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations The next question comes from Chris Pasquale at Nephron. Chris, please go ahead. Christopher Pasquale -- Analyst Thanks. I wanted to ask about the diabetes segment and your upcoming FDA submission for a Type 2 label expansion. How much of your current insulin pump installed base maybe in the U.S., that's easier, is made up of Type 2 patients? And how do you think about your opportunity in that segment without a more discrete on-body form factor, which seems to be a priority for many of those users? Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer I'll let Que answer the question on diabetes. Que. Que Dallara -- Executive Vice President and President, Diabetes Operating Unit Thanks for the question. On Type 2, we've finished enrollment. We expect to submit to FDA for the expanded indication in the first half of next calendar year. So, that's progressing very well. Today, as a percentage of our installed base, we're still largely a Type 1 business. We do see Type 2 as being quite a large opportunity. And the clinical data that we've generated for Type 2 is extremely good. So, we are, you know, actually quite optimistic about the Type 2 opportunity. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations OK. Thank you, Chris. Next question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations The next question comes from Pito Chickering at Deutsche Bank. Pito, please go ahead. Pito Chickering -- Analyst Hey. Good morning, guys. Going back to the 2025 guidance, in your updated guidance, you're absorbing more FX headwinds, increasing your EPS guidance. I think you told Travis that your margin guidance is 25.7% for the year. I think it was 25.8% last quarter. So, with revenue guidance up a little bit, FX headwind increasing, EPS moving up, is tax rate a positive tailwind for the back half of the year versus the previous guidance? I'm just trying to bridge the moving parts into the EPS guidance range. Thank you. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Gary, you want to take that? Gary Corona -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah, I'm happy to take that. You know, what I would say is FX on an EPS basis is very much in line with what we've been sharing all year, and that's really the power of our hedging program giving us good visibility. Revenue is up. Gross margins are essentially in line with our expectations. And we are, as I mentioned, investing behind the power of these launches, both commercially, as well as R&D. Tax is up a little bit. You know, we're navigating Pillar Two. But all in all, EPS is up a penny at the midpoint, and we're pleased with taking our guidance up today. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations OK. Thank you, Pito. Next question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations The next question comes from Anthony Petrone at Mizuho Securities. Anthony, please go ahead. Anthony Petrone -- Analyst Thanks and congrats on the quarter here. Back to renal denervation, just looking at some data, CMS is quoting 16 million patients 65-plus that have uncontrolled hypertension, but they're also on medications. So, just maybe a recap here. With the NTAP and TPT in place now, how much of that population can you go after and how much is still out there that you would need an NCD to sort of address that patient population? Thanks. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Hey, Sean, you want to take this one? Sean Salmon -- Executive Vice President and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio Yeah, sure. So, the payer mix is roughly 50-50 between those in Medicare and those not in Medicare -- Medicare and Medicaid I'd say. The TPT addresses the fee-for-service component of the Medicare-eligible patients that does not include those on Medicare Advantage. So, that's roughly split evenly between the two of those. So, the patient population is obviously very, very large here for those with uncontrolled hypertension, those with -- taking drugs but still having elevated blood pressure. As Geoff had noted in the beginning, it's really the -- minority of patients actually get control despite the availability of those drugs. So, I'd say, you know, Medicare, if it's 16 million, if that's the baseline, our numbers are more like 18 million for the uncontrolled hypertension patients, greater than 150 that are drug treated. The addressable market with in and out patients is about half the Medicare population. Medicaid is going to be a state-by-state determination, like commercial insurance would be. But suffice to say, there are a lot of patients that could be addressed with this therapy. The demand is really not the issue. It's going to be making sure we get that coverage and we establish centers that can do the procedure. Anthony Petrone -- Analyst Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations Thanks, Anthony. Next question, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations The next question comes from Rich Newitter at Truist Securities. Rich, please go ahead. Richard Newitter -- Analyst Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just going to spine. That continues to be a strong business for you guys. You're growing above market, especially in the U.S. I guess, you know, can you parse that a little bit? The market has been stronger here. So, I would just love to hear how much of a -- of the underlying market strength or the pickup in recent quarters or years is attributable to that. And I'm just trying to get a sense of how sustainable the high single-digit growth profile for your U.S. core spine franchise could be. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. First of all, look, it is a bit of -- we're seeing a bit of a market expansion here. We're also seeing a bit of market consolidation. There's a large tail of spine companies out there that are going away. And as I said in the commentary, this market is leaning toward those with scale and technology. But I'll let Brett go on some of the details here. Brett Wall -- Executive Vice President and President, Neuroscience Portfolio Yeah. Thanks, Rich. The market itself still remains strong. And as Geoff said, it really benefits companies with scale because of the consolidation and technology with the AiBLE system. And if you look at the technology that we're bringing to this, it recruits the best reps, it recruits the best physicians, and it brings together more market opportunity, much more significant opportunity across the world. So, we see this as sustainable, and we see this as a platform that we will continue to take share and continue to grow this business. Richard Newitter -- Analyst OK. Maybe just as a follow-up to that, you have a competitor, you know, the other main consolidator right now in the space who's approaching, you know, the anniversary of what felt -- what feels like it could be the worst case for disruption in the marketplace. You talked about the opportunity to take share as consolidation disruption is unfolding. Can you just update us on what you're seeing on that front? Thank you. Brett Wall -- Executive Vice President and President, Neuroscience Portfolio Yeah. You bet, Rich. You know, we have a good pipeline there, and we have -- had a good pipeline there of strong growth and, you know, good consolidation with more high-quality reps and other people coming toward Medtronic. And we're continuing to see that develop and we have a pipeline and significant opportunity into the future. And, you know, once again, it benefits companies with scale, it benefits with technology, and we see that continuing to occur and continuing to happen. Richard Newitter -- Analyst Thank you. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations Thanks, Rich. Next question please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations Next question comes from Danielle Antalffy at UBS. Danielle, please go ahead. Danielle Antalffy -- Analyst Thanks so much. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just a question on TAVR. There's been a lot of data over the last few weeks here in TAVR. You guys still are benefiting from the SMART trial. I'd just love to get a state of the nation on the TAVR market, where do you see that going from here, especially with the recent asymptomatic data that we saw and also one of your potential competitors, you know, at the very least delayed from entering the U.S. market. Thanks so much. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Sean, you want to hit the TAVR question? Sean Salmon -- Executive Vice President and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio Yeah. Thanks, Danielle. I think the market is in good shape. I think in line with what we've been saying in prior quarters. It's in that high single-digit range for growth. The expansion of the patient population, you know, there's continued opportunities for that. As you mentioned, the asymptomatic patient population, which I think, you know, affects as a class effect, would increase that. But the bigger unlock would be moderate aortic stenosis down the road, when we get -- when our trials read out there. And then there's sort of TAVI/TAVR indications that would also help expand that, along with continued global growth of the therapy. So, like, look, I think the evidence base that we've got, the strength of our product just gets better and better. The longer-term data really starts to distinguish what we've got. And we've got certain use conditions like small annulus that -- clearly, the hemodynamics of our valve are better. And what's really opened up the aperture for us as well is really eliminating the concerns of coronary access with the new FX+ product, which we've launched in the United States, just began launching also this quarter in Europe. And we'll be pursuing that technology into other world markets, including Japan, within the year. So, I think we're well-positioned, the market is healthy, and we still see lots of room for growth for a long time. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations OK. Thanks, Danielle. Next question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations The next question comes from Joanne Wuensch at Citi. Joanne, please go ahead. Joanne Wuensch -- Analyst Thank you so much and good morning. It's been a while, I think, since we've heard an update on your mitral valve replacement and repair programs. Could you sort of just give us an update on where you're thinking about that, as well as some tricuspid opportunities? Thank you very much. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Well, we'll stick with Sean on the structural heart questions. Sean Salmon -- Executive Vice President and President, Cardiovascular Portfolio Yeah. Thanks for the question. So, the intrepid valve, which is used in both the mitral position, as well as in the tricuspid position, continues in its trial for U.S. and European approval. That's the APOLLO trial. We're doing well in that study. I think the acceleration for the trial is really had by going into the 29 French version of the transseptal side of that. And we've seen really, really good results when we completely eliminate the regurgitation, which is very different than what we see with repair technologies. The clinical outcomes have been really excellent. We've taken on a population of those who are not clippable, those who can't get surgery, and patients with severe mitral annular calcification or MAC. So, that's really going to be the first indications for that. On the tricuspid front, it is the same valve. We're going to make some modifications for that in the future, but right now, we're using the existing intrepid valve in the tricuspid position in the early feasibility study. The iterations that we'll make are -- include sizes and just making it more fit for purpose in that location. But we continue to do well. We believe that elimination of regurgitation is better for patients. That's been our primary focus. And we have some other investments in repair technologies as well. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. I think just overall, just kind of recapping the last two questions, our structural heart business is in a good spot. You know, it's -- as Sean mentioned, we built on our TAVR franchise with data and product improvements. And then in the pipeline, he just went through mitral and tricuspid with intrepid. And this is -- you know, getting back to the other questions on mix, this is a good guy on our mix. It's a very profitable franchise for us. So, it's good to see that it's doing well and the underlying market is also doing well. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations OK. Thanks, Joanne. I think we have time for two more questions. Brad, we'll take the next question, please. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations The next question comes from Matt Miksic at Barclays. Matt, please go ahead. Matt Miksic -- Analyst Hey. Thanks for taking the question. So, I was hoping to, you know, keep in the Q&A here, just maybe clarify a couple of things that hadn't come up here in the Q&A and questions we get often from investors. So, just on a couple of the key pipeline programs. So, maybe pace and timing for Affera in the U.S. You know, I think, Sean, you talked about the NCD that's been cleared for RDN whether that's sort of in calendar '25, any sort of timing? I know that's a tough process to know about. And in diabetes, the patch pump is a topic we get often. When and what can you tell us? And just to again clarify something, I think it has come up a couple of times, is on earnings growth on the back half. So, the 5% headwind on EPS, it's about $0.26, $0.27, I think, if we do the math on that right and you got about a dime on that left of the impact on the back half. So, most of the impact of that FX headwind on EPS growth has been in the first half. Just any color or cadence or mechanics you can help us understand how that plays out in Q3 and Q4. I guess that's for Gary. But thanks so much. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. Thanks for the question, Matt. On -- look, on Affera, look, it's part of our PFA story. Obviously, we just got the approval. And this is one that we're in the process of ramping. We didn't quantify that exactly. But when you put it all together with PulseSelect, which is at a more scaled position, that's where we're getting the strong double-digit growth in Q3 and beyond. So, you know, it's -- we're not breaking out Affera specifically, but we are in the process of scaling that. You know, RDN, you know, the coverage, Sean went through the ins and outs of that. But to your point, Matt, it is difficult to predict exactly when -- you know, how the -- you know, when CMS gives some indication on coverage. We got, like, as you know, a strong indication or strong approval from the FDA with the broad indication. And -- you know, so we've got to see where CMS ends up. And as we've talked about, the conversations have been very constructive, but it's -- we don't want -- it's hard to predict timing on when they'll get back to us and publicize something. As far as diabetes goes, the patch programs, you know, remain dynamic. We've got a couple of shots on goal there. I don't believe we've given any timing on that other than, look, we've been investing heavily in diabetes across the entire -- one of our strengths is just the fact that we have the entire ecosystem, and patch needs to be part of that. We've got a couple of shots on goal here. And it's -- but we have not given a timing on that. And then as far as the earnings growth, as Gary mentioned, you know, we -- in the back half of the year, and I mentioned -- and then we mentioned in the commentary as well, we see a high single digit -- you know, we see that earnings growth that you saw on a constant currency basis that was high single digit, even double digit, we see that trend translating into the back half of the year, high single-digit realized EPS growth. I don't know if you have anything to add to that. Gary Corona -- Interim Chief Financial Officer Yeah. You hit the EPS, Matt. The foreign exchange headwind is pretty much spot on, 5 points for the year and about a dime in the second half. I know, you know, currency is on a lot of folks' mind. You know, we're a global company. And historically, it has been a thorn for us. But, you know, this is where you see the benefit of our hedging program, and it's a key part of our strategy as we think about the impact going forward. You know, one of the best things we can do is grow our U.S. business. We're also, you know, looking aggressively at dynamically pricing in devaluing currency environments, and we're seeing that in our results. And we're also looking at balancing our cost base around the world. So, we're taking action. It's a priority of mine. And as Geoff said, we'll see that high single-digit EPS in the second half. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer Yeah. No, I think on the currency thing, it's important -- I just want to reemphasize what Gary said. I mean, yeah, our hedging program can delay impact and help with stability in a given year, but we're really attacking this -- the underlying, you know, issues so that we don't -- we aren't exposed to it as much. And, you know, whether it's prioritizing, you know, putting a lot more investment into U.S. growth, but also a number of other actions, like Gary mentioned, like, you know, in some of these devalued -- countries that have constant devaluation of currency, a whole different pricing regimen there that's much more dynamic. And this is something that, you know, we're really committed to. Gary is really championing this and yelling from the mountaintops, as you can tell from his voice on this call. This is a priority for him and for us. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations OK. Thanks, Matt. We'll take our last question, please, Brad. Brad Welnick -- Senior Director, Investor Relations Our final question comes from Patrick Wood at Morgan Stanley. Patrick, please go ahead. Patrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Beautiful. Thank you. I'll keep it tight on this one. You know, given the focus on tuck-in M&A, I'm just curious the kind of assets that you're most interested on that side. And then, you know, obviously, there's language around looking at the portfolio of assets that you're running. Should we expect the potential for any slightly more radical repositioning of the business over the next coming years? Thanks. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer OK. Thanks, Patrick. You know, in terms of, you know, M&A, this is something we talked about in the last quarter as well. I mean, this is an important part of our growth algorithm, and, you know, the type of assets or the type of M&A we want to do is more tuck-in. And I don't want to forecast exactly where we're prioritizing, but I'll tell you this, it is a more of a top-down approach here where we're looking at the -- our leadership team, looking at the areas that we're prioritizing and really looking to those areas to be -- for that to be the priority areas for M&A. So, our high-growth markets, but also our high-growth segments that we've talked about. But also, some of our well-established businesses, from time to time, need some tuck-in support to keep them going because, you know, we're counting on a minimal amount of growth from them and a disproportionate amount of profits and cash flow. So, we want to make sure they're healthy. So, that's kind of -- within that, we're not getting much more specific. And then in terms of, you know, portfolio management, look, I just can't emphasize enough how important it is for us to -- this portfolio management is an ongoing process, not a destination. We're constantly looking at the portfolio to make sure it's constructed in a way that's aligned with our mission, aligned with our -- where our strength is. I mean, it's a competitive world out there. We want to make sure we're playing to our strengths, and we've got a number of those. But it also is constructed in a way that can give the company from a financial performance perspective that reliable, durable, mid-single-digit, innovation-driven growth at that mid-single-digit level on the top line that can translate with the profitability mix. Like, we went through some of the mix dynamics where we have some products that are negative on the mix and some that are -- businesses that are, you know, a good guy on the mix. We want to make sure that all adds up to that earnings leverage down the P&L and the translation to cash flow that gets you to, you know, the dividend and get you to that double-digit shareholder return. So, we are really actively looking at the portfolio, make sure it's constructed in a way to durably deliver that. And that's about as far as I can go on context on portfolio. Patrick Wood -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst Thanks so much, Geoff. Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations Thanks, Patrick. And we apologize if we weren't able to get to everyone in the queue this morning. So, feel free to follow up with me or anyone on the IR team after the call. So, with that, Geoff, please go ahead with your closing remarks. Geoffrey S. Martha -- Chair and Chief Executive Officer OK. Well, thanks to all the analysts for the questions and to all of you that joined us today. And like always, we certainly appreciate your support and your continued interest in Medtronic. And we hope you'll join us for our Q3 earnings broadcast, which we anticipate holding on Tuesday, February 18th, where we'll update you on our continued progress against our long-term strategies and our commitment. So, with that, again, thanks for joining us and have a great rest of your day. And for those of you in the U.S., wishing you and your families all a very Happy Thanksgiving next week. So, thank you, and have a good day. Duration: 0 minutes Ryan Weispfenning -- Vice President and Head, Investor Relations Geoffrey S.

Both the metrics were up on a year-over-year basis. The company’s robust innovation is driving sustained growth across many franchises, such as TAVR, Diabetes, Spine, and Neuromodulation among others. Within Neuromodulation, both Cranial & Spinal Technologies and Neuromodulation delivered an above-market performance. Expansion of adjusted operating margin in the quarter is encouraging.

This compares to earnings of $1.25 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items. This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.61%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this medical device company would post earnings of $1.20 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.23, delivering a surprise of 2.50%. Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times. Medtronic , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Products industry, posted revenues of $8.4 billion for the quarter ended October 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.75%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $7.98 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters. The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call. Medtronic shares have added about 6.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 23.6%. While Medtronic has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock? There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately. Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions. Ahead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Medtronic: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.37 on $8.41 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $5.44 on $33.6 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year. Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Medical - Products is currently in the top 50% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Another stock from the same industry, Veru Inc. (VERU), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2024. This company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +56.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.2% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. Veru Inc.'s revenues are expected to be $3.56 million, down 7.8% from the year-ago quarter. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Value investing can build great fortunes, and a hefty chunk of my portfolio is devoted to stable long-term wealth builders -- diversification is important, after all. But it's so much fun to look for tomorrow's big winners today. I have a few success stories under my belt, but they all took years to develop. My Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) buys are up by more than 1,000% each, but I started them in 2011 and 2010, respectively. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop?\\xa0Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.\\xa0Sign Up For Free » So I'm always looking for the next Netflix or Alphabet. What stocks can I buy today to collect huge returns over the next decade or two? My best ideas right now include media-streaming technology expert Roku (NASDAQ: ROKU) and restaurant management software maker Toast (NYSE: TOST). These growth stories are in their early chapters, and I expect them to continue winning for a very long time. Here's why I see market-stomping returns in the long run from Toast and Roku. The business models are very different, but Toast and Roku have a lot in common. Both companies are staring down enormous markets in the long run. Toast's radically simplified restaurant management system has been installed in 127,000 locations so far, and that's just 14.5% of the American restaurant market. Roku has reached 85.5 million media-streaming households, with annualized platform revenues (service fees and ad sales) of $3.6 billion. The Emarketer firm estimates the domestic TV advertising market to be worth more than $90 billion this year. And both companies have a lot of international growth to explore if and when they run out of greenfield growth opportunities in the U.S. So Toast and Roku are staring down massive long-term growth opportunities, and they are off to an impressive start. Roku's sales quadrupled over the last five years. Toast's quadrupled in three years. Both companies have seen solid cash profits in recent quarters, paid down their long-term debt balances to zero, and amassed billion-dollar cash reserves. Investors have embraced Toast recently, sending the stock price 120% higher year to date. The stock isn't cheap, trading at 50 times forward earnings estimates and 4.9 times trailing sales -- but I think it's worth every penny of that premium price. Roku, on the other hand, keeps doing everything right while the stock price is going down. After losing 21% of its value in 2024, Roku's shares are valued at just 2.5 times sales. Viewed in a different light, Roku's stock price stands 85% below its all-time highs. I get it if you think Toast looks expensive at the moment, and Roku would be my first choice, too. But don't stay on Toast's sidelines too long. You don't want to look back at years of market-beating gains from 2030 or 2035, kicking yourself for missing this opportunity. You can always set up your Toast and Roku positions in several transactions over time, perhaps buying in thirds or automating a dollar-cost averaging plan for the long haul. These approaches can smooth out market volatility and avoid getting stuck with a single buy at an uncomfortable starting price. Whatever buying method you prefer, Roku and Toast deserve a closer look from every growth investor. I can't promise that they will match my proven Netflix and Alphabet returns, but the opportunity is right there. I think we're looking at tomorrow's business giants in their early years. Roku is stealing market share from traditional TV networks and other online media channels. I'm finding Toast logos on my takeout receipts all over the place. Both companies have clearly defined, effective growth plans, and I see great long-term value in these stocks today.

The announcement comes a month after the CMA revealed it was launching a formal \"stage 1\" probe into Alphabet\\'s various investments in Anthropic, a 3-year-old San Francisco-based startup that develops large language models (LLMs) and an associated chatbot called Claude, which is akin to Google’s Gemini or OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Alphabet\\xa0reportedly invested $300 million\\xa0in Anthropic early last year,\\xa0followed by another $2 billion. Anthropic had courted other big names from the tech world, including Amazon, which invested $4 billion. The CMA was looking into that partnership, too. However in September it came to the same conclusion, announcing that it couldn’t investigate the arrangement under current merger rules due to the size and scope of the deal. These various investigations have formed part of a multipronged probe into what has been dubbed the \"quasi-merger,\" which has seen Big Tech firms take a fresh approach to gaining control of younger innovators through hiring startup founders and talent, and -- as is the case here -- by making strategic investments. However, the CMA has now said it \"does not believe that Google has acquired material influence over Anthropic as a result of the partnership.\" More specifically, the CMA said it considered whether the duo\\'s commercial relationship meant that Google could exert influence at the board level and whether a technical reliance on Google\\'s infrastructure (e.g., cloud computing resources) could play a role in stymying competition. In the event it decided that they could not. \"The available evidence did not indicate that Google has the ability to exercise material influence over Anthropic through the partnership,\" the CMA reiterated. Additionally, Anthropic didn\\'t meet the so-called turnover test to qualify for investigation, as Anthropic\\'s U.K. turnover doesn\\'t exceed £70 million (or around $88.5 million).

Andrew Bailey said retailers were “right” to warn of potential job cuts as a result of the £40bn of tax rises in the Chancellor’s speech last month, referring to an industry-wide letter published today. Dozens of Britain’s biggest retailers have warned Ms Reeves that her plans to hike employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) will cause staff to be laid off and shops to be shut. Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Bailey said: “I saw the BRC’s (British Retail Consortium’s) letter and I think they’re right to say, I think there is a risk here that the reduction in employment could be more. Yes, I think that’s a risk.” Mr Bailey added that companies would feel more pressure on margins from the tax rises in the short term, before the effect eases. He said: “Probably, initially, there will be more pressure on firms’ margins because it takes them longer to adjust and then they’ll probably rebuild those profit margins over time. I would expect that.” He added that the Bank of England will be forced to cut interest rates at a “gradual” pace as it assesses the impact of the Budget. Mr Bailey said: “There are different ways in which the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions announced in the Autumn Budget could play out in the economy.” He added: “A gradual approach to removing monetary policy restraint will help us to observe how this plays out, along with other risks to the inflation outlook.” Read the latest updates below.

The family owners of sex toy and lingerie chain Ann Summers have stepped in with millions of pounds in crucial funding after it racked up further losses. Vanessa Gold, who was appointed chairman last year following the death of sister and retail pioneer Jacqueline Gold, spearheaded a £5m cash call as the business reeled from the economic downturn. The loan was provided by Green Street Holdings, a Gold family-controlled entity, in August, following another year in which it failed to make a profit. Though turnover increased slightly from £101m to £104m in the year to July 2023, accounts for Ann Summers’ parent company reveal it posted another £3.9m of losses on the back of spiralling costs. The company blamed its latest challenges on a cocktail of external factors including inflationary spikes, higher taxes and store rents and the cost of living crisis. The Gold family, which has owned Ann Summers for nearly half a century, also lamented the impact of its own misfortune. The death of Jacqueline came just months after the passing of family patriarch David, forcing the remaining members of the Gold dynasty into a rapid review of their business interests. Read the full story... Staff at Hennessy, the cognac maker owned by French luxury giant LVMH, will continue their strike on Wednesday, a union representative said, to protest what he said was a plan to potentially bottle the brandy in China to avoid tariffs. About 500 workers, or half the workforce at the company’s bottling plant in Cognac in southwest France, had stopped work on Tuesday, the union said. Beijing imposed duties of more than 30pc on imports of bottled brandy from the EU in October, hitting Hennessy as well as other French companies such as Remy Cointreau and Pernod Ricard. China is the second-largest export market for cognac after the US and the industry’s most profitable territory, accounting for $1.7bn in exports last year. Difficult economic conditions in China and the US, however, have prompted a sharp decline in cognac sales. The industry is also suffering from a bad 2024 harvest. A plan to ship cognac in containers and bottle it in China rather than France was discussed last week by industry body Le Syndicat des Maisons de Cognac (SMC), according to Michael Lablanche, a regional representative for the CGT labour union. Bottling in China rather than France would allow companies to circumvent the tariffs but would be a “disaster” for workers, Mr Lablanche said. The Telegraph has approached Hennessy and SMC for comment. Europe’s main stock index touched its lowest level in three months on Tuesday, as escalating geopolitical tensions with Russia spurred investors to head to safer havens. The pan-European Stoxx 600 closed 0.4pc lower, after falling 1pc to its lowest point since Aug 8 earlier in the day. It logged a third straight day of losses. Poland, which borders Ukraine, saw its blue-chip index, WIG20 slide more than 3pc, falling the most among national indexes in Europe. Safe-haven assets such as gold and the US dollar were on the rise. The Kremlin said the aim of an updated nuclear doctrine was to make potential enemies understand the inevitability of Russian retaliation for an attack. Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com, said: Jaguar has scrapped its historic growling cat logo as the British car manufacturer gears up for the shift to electric vehicles. The luxury car maker unveiled a rebrand on Tuesday to accompany the launch of three electric models in 2026. The company described its new logo, which is written as JaGUar, as a “powerful celebration of modernism” that “seamlessly blends upper and lowercase characters in visual harmony”. It also unveiled a new “leaper” cat design on a lined brass background, as well as a monogram that will be used as a “flourish or finishing touch”. However, Jaguar is dropping its distinctive “growler” cat, which has been used for decades as the main badge on grilles and bonnets. Jaguar, whose parent company Jaguar Land Rover is owned by Indian car giant Tata Motors, said the rebrand captured the ethos of founder Sir William Lyons, who believed the marque should be a “copy of nothing”. The Guardian is braced for strike action after journalists voted overwhelmingly in favour of a walkout in protest over plans to sell The Observer to a loss-making startup. Almost 93pc of members voted in favour of industrial action in a ballot of more than 600 staff members organised by the National Union of Journalists (NUJ). Roughly 96pc voted in favour of action short of a strike. The vote means The Guardian is now facing the prospect of a mass walkout that could force it to shut down its print operations. The NUJ must give two weeks’ notice of industrial action, meaning the first strike could take place in early December. The union will meet on Wednesday to decide what action to take. The outcome underscores high levels of discontent among staff at Guardian Media Group (GMG) after the company revealed it was in exclusive talks to sell The Observer to Tortoise Media, a news startup founded by former BBC News boss James Harding.

Moody’s said a possible redress scheme to compensate customers who could have been mis-sold loans to buy cars could rise to £30bn. The estimate is the largest figure yet and underlines growing fears about how much the scandal could cost the UK bank sector. A Court of Appeal judgement last month increased concerns about the number of customers that banks may have to compensate. Before the decision, the Financial Conduct Authority had been exploring plans for a compensation scheme for bonuses paid to car dealers. The more recent court judgement has raised the prospect that more customers could claim some form of compensation. Moody’s said large lenders exposed to the issue like Lloyds Bank and Santander could withstand the problem but smaller banks like Close Brothers and Aldermore could take more strain. The FTSE 100 closed down 0.1pc, showing the least drop of the major European stock markets today. The biggest riser was BT, gaining 3.5pc, followed by tobacco giant Imperial Brands 3.1pc. At the other end of the index, distribution group Diploma fell 8pc, followed by aerospace giant Melrose Industries, down 2.8pc. Meanwhile, the mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 0.2pc The top riser was manufacturing business Bodycote, up 8pc, followed by molten metal flow engineering group Vesuvius, up about the same percentage. Burberry was the biggest faller, down 5.1pc, followed by self-storage company Big Yellow, down 4.9pc. Global stocks edged higher in choppy trading on Tuesday, amid rising tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine. Investors are eyeing president-elect Donald Trump’s pick for Treasury secretary, while mulling potential tariffs and tax cuts from the incoming Trump administration that could lead to higher inflation and to fewer interest rate cuts. George Young, portfolio manager at Villere & Co in New Orleans, said: The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were trading higher, with gains in technology stocks outweighing losses in materials, energy and healthcare equities. Artificial intelligence chipmaker Nvidia is scheduled to report earnings on Wednesday. The S&P 500 rose 0.2pc, the Nasdaq rose 0.5pc and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.3pc. A measure of global stocks, the MSCI World index, rose 0.2pc. Chinese president Xi Jinping reportedly told German chancellor Olaf Scholz today that he hoped Germany could help the EU and China to resolve the issue of tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles quickly. According to Chinese state broadcaster CCTV, Mr Xi said China was ready to work with Germany to “consolidate” an overall strategic partnership, before raising the issue of EU tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, which has increased the prospects of a trade war between Beijing and the bloc. Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported that Mr X said: Museum security guards are voting on whether to strike in a dispute over pay. Members of the United Voices of the World (UVW) based at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London will decide in the next few weeks if they want to launch a campaign of industrial action. The union said it is the first time the security guards, who are employed by a private contractor, are taking part in a strike ballot. Security guards at the Natural History and Science Museums in London have already walked out for six days during the school half-term and Halloween, also over pay. Petros Elia, general secretary of the UVW, said: “With the Victoria and Albert Museum security guards joining their colleagues from the Natural History and Science Museums, the dispute is escalating significantly and shows no signs of abating.” The Telegraph has approached the V&A for comment. British Airways has claimed it was able to fix an IT meltdown more quickly because of a £750m investment under\\xa0Sean Doyle, its\\xa0chief executive. The carrier said that computer upgrades prevented chaos from spiralling after dozens of services were affected by\\xa0technical issues shortly after 5pm on Monday. However, experts said the airline would none the less face a battle to reassure travellers flying over Christmas. While this week’s problem was fixed within hours and no flights were cancelled, the airline was not able to say what had caused it. Inquiries are understood to focus on the loading of digital flight plans used by pilots. The meltdown impacted departures from Heathrow and delayed return flights from other cities, while BA’s website and app were also unusable. Its secondary base at Gatwick was unaffected, most likely because it has fewer evening services. Shares of parent company IAG fell as much as 4pc when they began trading Tuesday. Read the full story... American, European and British stock indexes have mostly dropped today on heightened tensions between Russia and the West. The Vix - a measure of volatility in the Wall Street’s S&P 500 benchmark - jumped by 3.3pc. Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform\\xa0IG, said: New inflation figures, out tomorrow from the Office for National Statistics, will show an increase, according to Barclays. Julien Lafargue, chief market strategist at Barclays Private Bank, said: A month ago, we reported that inflation had dropped to its lowest level in more than three years, at 1.7pc. Handbag maker Mulberry has cut dozens of head office jobs as part of a major “rebuild” after revealing that sales had plunged. This morning we reported that sales had fallen by almost a fifth over the past half-year to £56.1m. The new boss of the fashion firm said he is simplifying the business in order to make it “leaner” as part of a strategic overhaul and help drive a return to profit. Andrea Baldo, who was appointed chief executive, said that the business has cut 85 roles as part of the shake-up. The cuts, which impact about a quarter of its 350-strong workforce, have predominantly impacted its London design headquarters, as well as some Somerset office workers. It is part of a strategic review, due to conclude next month, which will also see a shift in the company’s pricing and distribution strategies. Mr Baldo said he hopes to “reinvigorate” the brand by focusing on its “affordable luxury” price position and said it will seek to return to growth in the UK, a market he said the business had “underappreciated” in its previous strategy. The Somerset company, which was recently the target of takeover efforts by shareholder Frasers Group, is among firms to have been hit hard by a sharp slowdown in luxury spending. US stocks are continuing to struggle this afternoon amid escalations in the Russia-Ukraine war. The three main indexes, which all opened down, have regained some of their earlier losses. The S&P 500, is down 0.2pc and the Dow is down 0.6pc. However, the Nasdaq - which was down 0.5pc earlier - is now up 0.2pc. Investors moved into Treasury bonds today and other investments traditionally seen as safer during times of trouble. The losses were more severe in European stock markets, where France’s Cac 40 index is down 1.3pc and Germany’s Dax is down 1.4pc. They sank after Russia said Ukraine fired six US-made ATACMS missiles at it. Earlier in the day, Russian president Vladimir Putin formally lowered the threshold for Russia’s use of its nuclear weapons. Prices rose for US Treasury bonds, which are seen as some of the world’s safest investments. That in turn lowered their yields, and the 10-year Treasury yield fell to 4.38pc from 4.41pc late on Monday. Gold also rose 0.5pc and recovered some of the losses it sustained following Donald Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Canada’s inflation rate rose to 2pc in October, the country’s statistics agency said, but is still likely to set up another interest rate cut. Data from Statistics Canada showed inflation had nudged higher compared to September, when it was 1.6pc. The October data, which was consistent with analyst expectations, is in line with the Bank of Canada’s 2pc target. Analysts remained confident the Bank of Canada would press on with rate cuts when its governors meet on December 11. Canada had held its benchmark rate steady for almost a year at 5pc, the highest level in two decades, before initiating cuts in early June. I’ll head off at this point and hand you over to Alex Singleton, who will keep the updates coming from the markets. The Prime Minister has insisted that the Budget has not impacted working people’s payslips, after warnings from retailers about the impact of hiking National Insurance in the Budget. Asked about the warnings of redundancies, Sir Keir Starmer told ITV: “What we did in the Budget was balance the books and make sure we reintroduce stability into our economy after 14 dreadful years. “We ensured that there was no impact on the payslip of working people.” Pushed again on the idea that people will see an impact, Sir Keir claimed the Budget had been “welcomed across the board”. He said: “We invested in our NHS, we’ve invested in our schools, we’ve invested in the housing that people desperately need, and that’s why the Budget has been welcomed across the board.” Asked if he was blaming retailers, the Prime Minister said: “We have a £22bn black hole to fix left by the last government. “We’re determined to fix the foundations and that means that we’ve had to take difficult decisions, but we’ve taken those decisions without impacting on working people in their payslips.” Rachel Reeves’s Budget risks the “whole retail environment going into stagnation”, Telegraph readers have warned, as the Governor of the Bank of England said retailers were “right” to say it had put jobs at risk. Here are a selection of views from your fellow readers and you can join the debate in our comments section below: US stocks fell at the opening bell after Moscow said Ukraine fired six American long-range missiles at a border region in Russia overnight. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.8pc to 43,068.30 amid the heightened tensions, which saw Vladimir Putin widen the scope of Russia’s nuclear doctrine. The S&P 500 was down 0.5pc to 5,863.37 while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4pc to 18,708.76. Gas prices were lower despite heightened geopolitical tensions as Vladimir Putin signed a law allowing a nuclear response to long-range missile attacks on Russian soil. Dutch front-month futures, the European benchmark, fell 0.7pc to less than €47 per megawatt hour after closing at their highest level in a year on Monday. There had been concerns that Kremlin-backed Gazprom might without supplies through Ukraine in response to an arbitration ruling in favour of Austrian supplier OMV earlier this month. However, supplies have continued and prices have also been unaffected by Putin’s decision to change Russia’s official nuclear doctrine allowing a nuclear strike in response to an attack with long-range missiles. Oil was little changed today after a power outage at Europe’s largest oilfield pushed prices higher. Brent crude, the international benchmark, traded near $73 a barrel as Equinor gradually restarted production at the Johan Sverdrup oil field in the North Sea. Crude had surged 3.2pc on Monday as the dollar weakened, making commodities more attractive to investors. Prices remain elevated amid the growing tensions in Ukraine after Russia updated its nuclear doctrine. Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency has forecast a potential surplus of more than 1 million barrels a day next year amid faltering Chinese demand. Google’s partnership with AI start-up Anthropic will not face further investigation by the UK’s competition regulator, it has been confirmed. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said its provisional examination of the link-up between the firms had found that it does not qualify for investigation under the merger provisions of UK competition law. The CMA has previously raised concerns it had around tech giants investing heavily in emerging AI companies and entering into AI-based partnerships with them, warning the process was a way for the biggest companies to consolidate power and resources within the growing sector. Earlier this year, the regulator highlighted more than 90 partnerships and strategic investments between a handful of the same tech giants and AI start-ups in what it called an “interconnected web” - and has since launched investigations into a number of these deals, including those involving Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and ChatGPT maker OpenAI. On its examination of Google and Anthropic, the maker of generative AI chatbot Claude, the CMA said it had found that Google had not acquired the ability to materially influence Anthropic’s commercial policy and therefore the partnership did not meet the threshold for UK merger control to apply. The pound dropped against the yen and the Swiss Franc as investors rushed into safe-haven assets after a warning from Russia over its updated nuclear doctrine. Vladimir Putin issued a warning to the United States as he lowered the threshold for a nuclear strike just days after Joe Biden’s administration allowed Ukraine to fire American missiles deep into Russia. Investors bought into safe-haven currencies after Putin’s warning, with analysts arguing markets had been too complacent about geopolitical risks. They perceive sterling as a risky currency, while the so-called safe-haven assets are seen as stable and reliable stores of value when markets are experiencing instability. The pound dropped nearly 1pc versus yen to 194.18, its lowest level in a month, and fell as much as 0.5pc against the Swiss Franc to 1.114. Barring geopolitical turmoil, several analysts expect the pound to strengthen against the euro as the UK is unlikely to be the focal point for the incoming Trump administration. US stock indexes fell in premarket trading amid worries about escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. President Vladimir Putin said Russia could consider using nuclear weapons if it was attacked with long-range missilesthat were supported by a nuclear power. It comes after the United States allowed Ukraine to fire American-made long-range weapons deep into Russia. Investors rushed to safe-haven assets including government bonds, gold and the Japanese yen. The CBOE Volatility index - known as Wall Street’s fear gauge - briefly jumped to its highest since the US election. In premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.5pc, the S&P 500 had fallen 0.3pc and the Nasdaq 100 slipped 0.1pc. Credit: Telegram / Astra / Exilenova+ Google is facing demands from the US government to sell Chrome, the world’s most popular web browser, as part of a landmark attempt to break up the company. In an escalation of tensions between the Department of Justice (DoJ) and Google, US officials are expected to request the forced sale in a legal filing later this week. Chrome, first released in 2008, has two-thirds of the global web browser market and is seen as one of Google’s most successful products, boosting its advertising business and propping up its search engine dominance. Read how being forced to sell the browser would reshape the tech industry. The Governor of the Bank of England has said retailers were “right” to warn of potential job cuts as a result of tax rises in the Budget, referring to an industry-wide letter published today. Andrew Bailey said: “I saw the BRC’s (British Retail Consortium’s) letter and I think they’re right to say, I think there is a risk here that the reduction in employment could be more. Yes, I think that’s a risk.” Speaking to the Treasury Select Committee, Mr Bailey added that companies would feel more pressure on margins from the tax rises in the short term, before the effect eases. He said: “Probably, initially, there will be more pressure on firms’ margins because it takes them longer to adjust and then they’ll probably rebuild those profit margins over time. I would expect that.” The Governor of the Bank of England has called for an “active dialogue” with the US amid speculation that Donald Trump will impose trade tariffs on other countries. Andrew Bailey said: “I would be very clear, fragmenting the world economy is not a good thing.” However, Mr Bailey added that he does not want to “jump to conclusions” on the effect of particular tariffs on UK policy. “I don’t think we can make that judgment today because we literally do not know what their intentions are.” He said policymakers should, therefore, “be in an active dialogue with the Trump administration on those policies as they affect the UK”. The Bank of England will be forced to cut interest rates at a “gradual” pace as it assesses the impact of the Chancellor’s £40bn Budget tax raid, Andrew Bailey has said. The Governor of the Bank said there could be a number of different outcomes from the £25bn increase in employer National Insurance contributions (Nics) and the rise in the minimum wage coming into effect from April. He said businesses could raise prices causing higher inflation, there could be lower wage increases, a reduction in employment, a squeeze in profit margins or an increase in productivity. Mr Bailey said: “There are different ways in which the increase in employer National Insurance Contributions announced in the Autumn Budget could play out in the economy.” He added: “A gradual approach to removing monetary policy restraint will help us to observe how this plays out, along with other risks to the inflation outlook.” Andrew Bailey said he does not understand advocates for carrying out Brexit “in the most hostile fashion possible” as the UK prepares for a potential global trade war. The Governor of the Bank of England was asked about the potential impact of tariffs on Britain’s economy with the return of Donald Trump to the White House. He said Britain should pursue an “active dialogue with the Trump administration” and “likewise, we should be in an active dialogue with the EU as well”. He said the outcomes of Britain’s departure from the European Union had been “better than we feared they would be back in 2016”, which he said was a result of “open dialogue and open relations” with Europe. He said “they have to trust us with financial services”, adding “I think we’ve done that. We’ve put a lot of effort into that”. He said: “And I, you know, I find it hard to understand people who seem to say that we should implement Brexit in the most hostile fashion possible. “And I take no position on Brexit. I never have, but I’ve always said it’s my job to get on and do it. And I think talking, you know, having a relationship with the European Union is the better way to do it.” The Budget pushed up the cost of mortgages, Andrew Bailey has told MPs, after the Chancellor announced £70bn of annual spending increases over the next five years. The Governor of the Bank of England said the cost of mortgages were also pushed higher by the uncertainty caused by the US election, which sent the cost of government borrowing higher following the election of Donald Trump. Mortgage rates have risen in recent weeks despite the Bank of England cutting interest rates for the second time this year last week, after announcing a first reduction in the Bank Rate in August. Mr Bailey told the Treasury Select Committee that “the curve rose”, referring to the various UK mortgage borrowing rates. He said: “I would say, really, we’ve had a lot of event at risk recently, and there were two things that have moved the curve around. “One, one, there was a reaction to the UK budget. And secondly, there’s been quite a reaction to the US presidential election. So we have seen some rise in the curve.” The Governor of the Bank of England is appearing in front of the Treasury Select Committee today, where he has said policymakers are putting emphasis on a “gradual” reduction on interest rates. Andrew Bailey said that services inflation remains incompatible with the Bank’s 2pc inflation target. Fellow policymaker Catherine Mann, who was the only member of the Monetary Policy Committee to vote against cutting interest rates last week, said she is concerned about inflation lasting for longer. She said she took into account two aspects of the Budget, which she said was front-loaded on demand and “geographically dispersed”, which offers the opportunity for companies to “realise” price increases. A fourth-generation family farmer said there is a possibility he and other farmers will strike if changes to agricultural property relief are not reversed. Richard Wainwright, 58, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, was at Church House Conference Centre in central London on Tuesday morning ahead of a meeting with the National Farmers’ Union (NFU). Mr Wainwright, whose grandfather began farming with a few cows and delivered milk to the surrounding area, said: “We are talking about possibly striking. “I hope it doesn’t come to that because that’s seriously going to impact the food chain.” On the impact on his farm, he said: “We’ve got to possibly sell a 20pc share of the farmland to be able to cover the tax bill. For us it’s around £600,000 we are going to have to pay. “It’s like I’m going to have to buy my own farm back.” The pound has fallen as investors closely watch US President-elect Donald Trump’s search for a Treasury Secretary. Sterling was down 0.4pc against the dollar to $1.263, near its lowest since June, as traders wait to see what the chosen candidate will mean for the US economy. Mr Trump is thought to be considering Apollo Global Management chief executive Marc Rowan and former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh. Chris Turner, head of forex strategy at ING, said: “The relevance of the pick for financial markets will probably be how the US Treasury market reacts.” The pound was flat against the euro, which is worth 83.6p. Cosmetics brand Revolution Beauty has swung to a first-half loss as sales slumped and it wrote-off old stock under its revamp plan. The group reported pre-tax losses of £10.9m for its half-year to August 31 compared to profits of £400,000 a year earlier. It follows a tough first half for the company, with sales plunging by 20pc to £72.4m as it simplified its product offering and ramped up clearance promotions to shift old stock. The business was also sent tumbling into the red after being hit by a £10.2m write-off on old stock as it continues the shake-up. But Revolution Beauty, which sells make-up, skincare, hair and body products online and through concessions, insisted it was making “encouraging progress with existing and new retailers”. New retail tie-ups also include the group expanding into 250 new Boots stores across the UK last month, while US retail giant Walmart will stock a full range of Revolution Beauty products in more than 1,800 stores from next January. Lauren Brindley, group chief executive, said: “This is a year of transformation for Revolution Beauty, and our performance in the first half reflects the steps we have taken to position the group for long-term, profitable growth.” The price of gold and other safe-haven assets has bounced after Russia updated its nuclear doctrine allowing it to expand use of its deterrent. Government bonds and the Japanese yen have also surged after Vladimir Putin’s approval on Tuesday of the updated nuclear doctrine. Putin signed a decree allowing Russia to fire nuclear weapons in response to a massive conventional attack on its soil, including by drones. Gold was up 0.7pc to $2,629 an ounce while government bond yields fell around the world. The FTSE 100 edged higher in early trading despite a warning from retailers that the Budget would deliver a £7bn blow to thier finances. The UK’s blue-chip index was up 0.2pc, while the midcap FTSE 250 was up 0.1pc. Mulberry dropped 14.4pc after revealing widening losses amid a broad slowdown for the luxury sector. Other fashion brands like Burberry were down 4.5pc after retailers wrote a letter to the Chancellor warning the sector faces £7bn in increased costs as a result of changes to employers’ national insurance, a higher minimum wage rise and levies on packaging. Specialised products and service distributor Diploma slumped as much as 4.5pc to the bottom of the FTSE 100 after its stock was downgraded by Shore and Jefferies following the publication of its full-year results. Investors are waiting to see the latest inflation figures for Britain, which will be published on Wednesday. Cigarette maker Imperial Brands increased sales of products like vapes and nicotine pouches as profits rose. Revenues from “next generation products” increased by 26pc to £335m, meaning the shift into tobacco alternatives now represents 8pc of net revenue in Europe. Shares rose 1.9pc as operating profits rose 4.6pc on a constant currency basis to £3.9bn, with earnings per share up 10.9pc to 297p. Chief executive Stefan Bomhard said: “In next generation products, we continue to build scale across our footprint with net revenues up 26.4pc at constant currency driven by growth from all three regions and market share growth in all three categories. “Our partnership approach to product innovation has enabled us to launch new products across all three categories during the year. This included our successful entry to the fast-growing modern oral category in the US with our brand ‘Zone’.” German industrial giant Thyssenkrupp suffered a massive annual loss for the second year running, as it battles challenges including a crisis in its historic steel division. The conglomerate, whose products range from steel to submarines, booked a loss of €1.5bn (£1.3bn) for the 2023-24 financial year, after a loss of over €2bn the previous year. Once a symbol of German industrial might, Thyssenkrupp has suffered as high manufacturing costs at home, falling prices for its products and fierce competition from Asian rivals hammered its traditional steel business. Chief executive Miguel Lopez said “very challenging market conditions” had weighed on the Essen-based group but insisted that it had made “key progress” in pushing through a major restructuring. Germany’s economy narrowly avoided a recession in the third quarter and its economy remains in turmoil as it prepares for a snap election called by chancellor Olaf Scholz. The group, which runs its financial year from October to September, is predicting a return to profit in the next fiscal year of €100m to €500m. Policing minister Dame Diana has defended the changes to inheritance tax as farmers travelled to Westminster to campaign against the move. Farmers have been told by the Chancellor that they must pay inheritance tax to fund the NHS, despite mass protests planned for today. Rachel Reeves has refused to back down over her controversial plan to impose inheritance tax on farms in the face of warnings that it could threaten food security, end the tradition of family farms and create a mental health crisis. Asked if she wanted to apologise to farmers, Ms Johnson told Times Radio: “I fully understand the strength of feeling that the farming community have and, of course, they have the right to come and protest and lobby Parliament, as we’re seeing happening already this morning. “But the Labour government, when it came in in July, was having to face some very difficult decisions because of the economic mess that we inherited and the £22 billion black hole in the public finances. “So, difficult decisions have had to be made. So, I think that that is the backdrop to this. “I also want to recognise that there is money going into farming. There’s over £5bn over the next two years that the Government is putting into farming and the number of farms that will be affected by the changes are relatively small.” The FTSE 100 opened higher as investors await inflation figures this week. The UK’s blue-chip index was up 0.4pc to 8,139.60 while the midcap FTSE 250 rose 0.3pc to 20,451.13. KitKat maker Nestle has revealed plans to slash costs by at least another 2.5bn Swiss francs (£2.2bn) and spin off its premium water and drink business as part of an overhaul. The plans, being led by new chief executive Laurent Freixe, will see the Swiss group make the mammoth savings by the end of 2027 - on top of an ongoing existing programme to trim costs by 1.2bn Swiss francs (£1.1bn). It said work “has already begun on key initiatives across procurement, commercial investments and structural costs” as it looks to ramp up cost-cutting. Mr Freixe said the group will instead channel spending into advertising and marketing, with investment in those areas being increased by up to 9pc of sales by the end of 2025. Nestle added that its water and premium drinks arm - which includes brands like Maison Perrier and Acqua Panna - will become a separate global standalone business as of January 1 next year. Its new management team will “evaluate the strategy for this business”, including possible partnership deals. Handbag maker Mulberry suffered deepening losses in the first half of its financial year as sales in China plunged. The boss of the luxury British brand said he needs to “rebuild the business” after sales plunged by almost a fifth over the past six months. The Somerset company, which was recently the target of takeover efforts by shareholder Frasers Group, is among those hit hard by a sharp slowdown in luxury spending. Mulberry told shareholders that group revenues fell by 19pc to £56.1m for the six months to September 28, with retail sales down 52pc in China and 29pc in South Korea. Pre-tax losses widened to £15.7m for the period, compared with a £12.8m loss a year earlier. Chief executive Andrea Baldo said: “In response to current market conditions, we have taken decisive steps to streamline operations, improve margins, reduce working capital, and strengthen our cash position. “This has also meant reviewing our internal team structure to ensure we become a leaner, more agile organisation. He added: “There is no question that our industry is facing a period of significant uncertainty, driven by a challenging and volatile macroeconomic environment that is impacting consumer confidence in several markets, particularly in our home country.” Retailers have warned they have been left with choices that lead to “no growth” after Rachel Reeves’s Budget left the sector facing a £7bn bill. Dozens of Britain’s biggest retailers have warned the Chancellor that her plans to hike National Insurance will cause staff to be laid off and shops to be shut. Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon and Accessorize, said retailers had been left with the choice of either protecting staff numbers of cancelling their investment plans. He told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: “We’re trying to protect that staff number and it’s about choices in how we protect it. For us it means passing on some of those cost increases in terms of increased prices. “It also means we’re probably going to have to divert investment that we would have made in growing our store base into protecting the stores that we have and the employees that we have. “It’s about making choices. None of those choices are a great path forward for us, none of them lead to growth. “These are forcing us to do things that seem to be entirely counter to the Government’s agenda in terms of growing the economy and growing sectors like ours.” Thanks for joining us. Retailers have claimed Rachel Reeves’s Budget has left them facing choices that do not lead to growth. Nick Stowe, chief executive of Monsoon, said the decisions bosses would have to make run “counter” to Sir Keir Starmer’s aims to get the economy growing. Retailers said the Budget would leave them facing £7bn of cost increases.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll In Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy A Bug’s Eye View of Mexico City’s Modernist Architecture The department will ask the judge, who ruled in August that Google illegally monopolized the search market, to require measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system, according to people familiar with the plans. Should a sale proceed, Chrome would be worth “at least $15-$20 billion, given it has over 3 billion monthly active users,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. Antitrust officials, along with states that have joined the case, also plan to recommend Wednesday that federal judge Amit Mehta impose data licensing requirements, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter. If Mehta accepts the proposals, they have the potential to reshape the online search market and the burgeoning AI industry. The case was filed under the first Trump administration and continued under President Joe Biden. It marks the most aggressive effort to rein in a technology company since Washington unsuccessfully sought to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Owning the world’s most popular web browser is key for Google’s ads business. The company is able to see activity from signed-in users, and use that data to more effectively target promotions, which generate the bulk of its revenue. Google has also been using Chrome to direct users to its flagship AI product, Gemini, which has the potential to evolve from an answer-bot to an assistant that follows users around the web. Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said the Justice Department “continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case.” She added, “the government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.” The Justice Department declined to comment. Alphabet shares were little changed as the markets opened Tuesday in New York. They had closed at $176.80 and have gained 25% this year. Chrome Access Antitrust enforcers want the judge to order Google to sell off Chrome because, as the most widely used browser worldwide, it represents a key access point through which many people use its search engine, the people said. The government has the option to decide whether a Chrome sale is necessary at a later date if some of the other aspects of the remedy do not create a more competitive market, the people added. The Chrome browser controls about 61% of the market in the US, according to StatCounter, a web traffic analytics service. Government attorneys met with dozens of companies over the past three months as they prepared the recommendation. States are still considering adding some proposals and some details could change, the people said. The antitrust officials pulled back from a more severe option that would have forced Google to sell off Android, the people said. Alphabet’s Google Bracing for Antitrust Rigmarole: Legal Outlook The benefit of Chrome, which Google doesn’t charge for directly, is partially in the convenience it provides users, by making their experience with Google products more seamless, said Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, on CNBC. “Breaking up these companies is not going to fundamentally address the annoyance you have with them.” Google said in a blog post that if other companies owned Chrome, they wouldn’t have the incentive to invest as heavily in it or keep it free, and would likely have to change its business model. Google Appeal Mehta’s August ruling that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets followed a 10-week trial last year. The company has said it plans to appeal. The judge has set a two-week hearing in April on what changes Google must make to remedy the illegal behavior and plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025. The agency and the states have settled on recommending that Google be required to license the results and data from its popular search engine and give websites more options to prevent their content from being used by Google’s artificial intelligence products, said the people. The antitrust enforcers are set to propose that Google uncouple its Android smartphone operating system from its other products, including search and its Google Play mobile app store, which are now sold as a bundle, the people said. They are also prepared to seek a requirement that Google share more information with advertisers and give them more control over where their ads appear. Lawyers from the Justice Department and state attorneys general included all of those options in an initial filing in October, as well as a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of the case against Google. A forced spin-off, if it happens, would also hinge on finding an interested buyer. Those who could afford and might want the property, like Amazon.com Inc., are also facing antitrust scrutiny that may prevent such a mega-deal. “My view is this is extremely unlikely,” Mandeep Singh, a Bloomberg Intelligence analyst, said in an email. But, he added, he could see a buyer like OpenAI, the maker of artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. “That would give it both distribution and an ads business to complement its consumer chatbot subscriptions.” A merger with a US-based AI player may more easily pass government scrutiny than another tech giant, said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, digital advertising and media analyst at Emarketer. It “could conceivably be approved by the government as a way to prioritize AI innovation and US posturing around AI on the global stage.” AI Overviews Google now displays artificial intelligence-based answers at the top of its search pages billed as “AI Overviews.” While websites can opt-out of having their information used by Google to create AI models, they can’t afford to opt out of the overviews because that would risk pushing them down in search results, making it harder to reach their customers. Website publishers have complained that the feature dampens traffic and advertising dollars since users rarely click through to see the data being used to power those results. Earlier: Google’s AI Search Gives Sites Dire Choice: Share Data or Die Regarding data licensing, the antitrust enforcers plan to propose two options: That Google sell the underlying “click and query” data and also separately syndicate its search results, according to the people. The company currently sells syndicated search results, but with restrictions, such as preventing their use on mobile. Forcing Google to syndicate its search results would allow rival search engines and AI startups to quickly improve their quality, while the data feed would allow others to build their own search index. --With assistance from Nick Turner, Davey Alba and Julia Love.

Its recent acquisitions are expected to drive revenue growth in the long term. Meanwhile, headwinds, such as currency movements and dull macroeconomic conditions, raise concern for Boston Scientific. In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 66.1% compared with the industry’s 21.4% growth and the S&P 500 composite’s 29.2% gain. The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $128.21 billion. BSX beat on earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 8.29%. Let’s delve deeper. Impressive Value-Adding Acquisitions: Boston Scientific’s impressive recent acquisitions have added numerous products with immense potential. This, in turn, should help boost the top line in the long term. The company’s recently completed strategic buyouts include a $3.7 billion acquisition of Axonics. This acquisition is aimed at expanding BSX’s differentiated technologies portfolio within Urology. Additionally, the company completed the acquisition of Silk Road Medical for $1.16 billion. This acquisition should help the company progress in vascular medicine, where Silk Road has revolutionized stroke prevention and the treatment of carotid artery disease. International Expansion Continues: Boston Scientific successfully expands operations across different geographies outside the United States. The company is putting additional efforts to expand its foothold in the emerging markets (which are defined as all countries except the United States, Western and Central Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) that hold strong growth potentials based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors and global capabilities. Despite geopolitical weaknesses in the third quarter of 2024, the emerging market registered sturdy growth, primarily banking on continued broad-based momentum across the company’s business and investment in this region. During this period, emerging markets' net sales grew nearly 16.8% year over year on an operational basis. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Boston Scientific is successfully expanding its base on the back of its diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand. In the third quarter, EMEA sales grew 14.3% year over year on an operational basis, banking on above-market performance in Electrophysiology. In Asia Pacific, Boston Scientific is particularly registering strong growth in China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. It also grew in the mid-teens despite recent volume-based procurement implementations. Exposure to Currency Movement: Boston Scientific records 40% of its sales from the international market. Therefore, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a major dampener over the past few quarters. In the second quarter, the company had a 160 basis-point impact on revenues from unfavorable currency fluctuations.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Macroeconomic Headwinds Dent Growth: Difficult macroeconomic conditions, international conflicts, unstable financial market dynamics and volatility in the price and availability of goods and services are laying pressure on Boston Scientific’s profitability. With such sustained macroeconomic pressures, the company may struggle to keep its operating expenses in check. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a 19.2% rise in the cost of products sold. Further, selling, general and administrative expenses rose 25.8%, resulting in a 123 basis point contraction in operating margin. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has increased 2.5% to $2.46 per share in the past 30 days. The consensus estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $16.58 billion, which indicates a 16.4% increase from the year-ago reported numbers. Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Globus Medical GMED and Penumbra PEN. Haemonetics has an earnings yield of 5.02% compared with the industry’s 1.18%. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 19.39%.

The trial data provided clinical evidence indicating that LAAC with the WATCHMAN FLX device is safe and superior to oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy for reducing the risk of long-term bleeding events in patients who have undergone an ablation. The OPTION trial data were presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2024 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Following the announcement, shares of BSX moved north 4% to $90.45 yesterday. The company’s structural heart programs are building momentum, banking on the strong performance of the WATCHMAN LAAC device. The next-generation WATCHMAN FLX and FLX Pro are strongly capturing the global market. In the third quarter of 2024, WATCHMAN’s organic sales grew 18% year over year. Accordingly, we expect market sentiment to remain positive surrounding the announcement. BSX currently has a market capitalization of $128.1 billion. It has an earnings yield of 17.1%, much higher than the industry’s 12.6%. The trial met the primary safety endpoint of non-procedural major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding at 36 months. In line with this, the WATCHMAN FLX device was found to be superior to OAC. Notably, trial data showed high rates of procedural success in patients who had a WATCHMAN FLX implant after an ablation, which reinforced positive outcomes such as low rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke within the trial population. These positive primary outcomes indicate that patients receiving the WATCHMAN FLX device can eliminate long-term medication use while maintaining stroke protection. With this positive data, the company aims to expand the indication for the WATCHMAN FLX platform. The randomized, controlled OPTION trial included 1,600 patients enrolled across 114 sites in the United States, Europe and Australia. In the trial, approximately 60% of device patients had their WATCHMAN FLX implant 90-180 days following their ablation procedure. Nearly 40% of the other device patients had the two procedures performed concomitantly, with the WATCHMAN FLX implant taking place after the ablation. The study compared the device with first-line OAC therapy, which included direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) (95%) and warfarin (5%) for stroke risk reduction in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation following a cardiac ablation. In addition to the OPTION trial, the WATCHMAN technology is being evaluated against DOAC therapy in lower-risk patients within the CHAMPION-AF randomized trial. The latest-generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro LAAC device is similarly being studied in several clinical trials, including the SIMPLAAFY randomized controlled trial, which is evaluating a single-drug alternative to dual antiplatelet therapy as a post-procedural regimen.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research According to a Precedence Research report, the global left atrial appendage closure devices market is projected to grow around $7.01 billion by 2034, at a compound annual growth rate of 14.1% from 2024 to 2034. The rising prevalence of atrial fibrillation and rising government initiatives contribute to the market's growth. Technological advancements are also promoting growth. The company recently acquired Axonics, Inc. at an equity value of $3.7 billion. In the past year, shares of BSX have risen 66.1% compared with the industry’s 21.4% growth.

The deal, originally announced in January this year, enables Boston Scientific’s entry into sacral neuromodulation (SNM), a high-growth adjacency for its Urology business. The company paid $71 cash per share to Axonics, representing an equity value of $3.7 billion and an enterprise value of $3.3 billion. The transaction is expected to be immaterial to adjusted earnings per share in 2024 and 2025 and accretive thereafter. However, on a GAAP basis, Boston Scientific anticipates the transaction to be less accretive or more dilutive due to amortization expenses and acquisition-related charges. After the Nov. 15 announcement, shares of BSX jumped 3.3%, finishing at $90.45 in yesterday’s session. \\xa0Boston Scientific is consistently gaining market share within its MedSurg segment. Within Urology, the Stone Management and Prostate Health franchises are growing well owing to the strong performances of Rezum and SpaceOAR. The Endoscopy business is also gaining from strong worldwide demand for its broad range of gastrointestinal and pulmonary treatment options.\\xa0We expect the market sentiment toward BSX stock to remain positive surrounding this development. Boston Scientific currently has a market capitalization of $128.21 billion. The company has an estimated 2024 earnings growth of 20% compared to the industry’s 11.4% growth. It delivered an earnings beat of 8.29%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. Irvine, CA-headquartered Axonics’ products are available in more than 20 countries. The portfolio includes SNM therapy for overactive bladder (OAB) and incontinence, which is a minimally invasive procedure that works by delivering mild electrical pulses to the sacral nerve to restore communication between the brain and the bladder. The company launched its first rechargeable SNM device for OAB in November 2019 and treated nearly 100,000 incontinence patients globally in 2023. Axonics reported net revenues of approximately\\xa0$366 million last year, growing 34% over 2022 with attractive gross margins. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The latest acquisition is strategic and financially compelling for Boston Scientific, expanding its ability to offer clinically differentiated treatment options with well-established therapies in a high-growth adjacency. In the United States, the market for SNM is large and significantly underpenetrated, presenting a major opportunity for Boston Scientific to leverage its global reach and capabilities to accelerate the awareness and adoption of Axonics technologies. Per a research report, the global sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) market was valued at $1.6 billion in 2023 and is expected to witness a compound annual rate of 11.5% by 2030. The market growth is attributed to the increasing rates of overactive bladder conditions and the incidence of urge incontinence, including UTIs. Advancements in technology and increased awareness of SNS as an effective treatment option enhance its adoption. This month, Boston Scientific announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cortex, Inc., an Ajax Health company.\\xa0Cortex has developed the OptiMap System, which uses a basket catheter and proprietary algorithm to identify potential active AF (atrial fibrillation) sources, providing physicians with precise insights to efficiently deliver an individualized ablation strategy for their patients.\\xa0The company expects to complete the transaction in the first half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.

At least that\\'s according to a report by investment bank Morgan Stanley, which estimates the brain-computer interface (BCI) market could be the next opportunity for investors, with a total addressable market of $400 billion. \"This is, to us, the next big opportunity in med tech — and it\\'s rare,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Kallum Titchmarsh told Yahoo Finance. \"BCIs have been in development for 100 years essentially. When you are five years away from full commercial launches, I think it\\'s time to get excited and get ahead of the curve.\" Titchmarsh covers medical technology stocks, such as Inari Medical (NARI), Penumbra (PEN), Sight Sciences (SGHT), Irhythm Technologies (IRTC), Nevro (NVRO), Inspire Medical Systems (INSP), and Embecta (EMBC), at Morgan Stanley. The report, published last month, estimates the commercial launch of BCIs in about five years. \"On our numbers, we expect just under $1.5 billion of revenue to be generated from BCI implant procedures out to 2035 (hitting north of a $500 million annual run rate in 2036), and hitting the $1 billion annual run rate by 2041,\" the report said. \"To us, these numbers seem very plausible, particularly when compared to existing med tech end markets...\" Analysts told Yahoo Finance that several neuro-technology companies are vying to be the Apple (AAPL) of their industry. Titchmarsh estimates the penetration will be limited in the first 20 years of launch — likely sitting at less than 3% by 2045. \"But still, this is such a large target market, you don\\'t really need too much penetration to be generating quite significant revenues,\" he said. Morgan Stanley broke the market into two categories: enabling BCIs and preventative BCIs. Enabling BCIs would help patients who have already lost their ability to move or speak as a result of a severe neurological disease or traumatic injury. Preventative BCIs would stop conditions such as depression and epilepsy. Initial applications will help those with motor neuron disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (40,000 and 30,000 people), spinal cord injury (300,000), stroke (900,000), multiple sclerosis (1 million), cerebral palsy (500,000), limb amputation (2.5 million), epilepsy (3 million), and depression (21 million, 2.5 million with severe treatment-resistant). \"In the future, there will be no phones, just Neuralinks,\" Elon Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, in June. Musk co-founded BCI company Neuralink in 2016, which is now valued at a reported $8 billion. There are several others making big strides that are backed by the richest people in the world. Synchron, a company that implants its chip through the blood vessels with no drilling of the skull, has its Series C funding round backed by Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. The company has an estimated valuation of about $400 million. Palantir (PLTR) co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel has poured at least $10 million into Blackrock Neurotech, which sports a valuation of a reported $350 million. German billionaire Christian Angermayer is on the board of Blackrock Neurotech and is also an investor. Titchmarsh is focusing on four players he says currently lead the pack: Neuralink, Synchron, Precision Neuroscience, and Paradromics. \"I think being first is super important,\" Titchmarsh said, adding that whichever company is first to market will get the foothold on reimbursement. \"It\\'s rare to see four or five players in a med tech space compete. It is more likely we\\'ll see probably three.\" He expects that within the first few years of a commercial launch, the market will be narrowed down to three key players. Beyond that the likelihood of acquisitions by public companies is high. \"Three large companies have neuromodulation businesses: Medtronic, Abbott, and Boston Scientific,\" Titchmarsh said. \"But this seems very unique of a market, and it may actually be better in the hands of these companies as kind of pure plays for now so that it doesn\\'t get lost in the broader development pipeline. Would I be surprised in 10 years if one of these large med tech companies had a BCI? Not at all.\" Last month, Precision Neuroscience closed a $93 million funding round, valuing the startup at around $500 million. \"We view brain-computer interfaces as a generationally important life sciences innovation and one that really is ... going to have applicability today in paralysis, tomorrow in a number of different areas,\" Michael Mager, co-founder and CEO of Precision Neuroscience, told me at Yahoo Finance\\'s Invest conference (video above). \"We tried to build this company from the very beginning to go the distance.\" Catch more in-depth conversations from Yahoo Finance\\'s Invest conference Precision has temporarily implanted its device, called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, into more than two dozen patients during clinical trials. The company uses a minimally invasive approach that doesn\\'t penetrate the brain like its competitors. Precision Neuroscience\\'s co-founder and chief science officer, Benjamin Rapoport (formerly of Neuralink), said the technology goes beyond med tech. \"There\\'s an aspect of it that is novel manufacturing techniques,\" Rapoport, a practicing neurosurgeon, told Yahoo Finance. \"There\\'s an aspect of it that is supply chain related. There\\'s a significant aspect of it that\\'s artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven. We\\'re pushing so many limits on all these fronts that there\\'s not really any other, to date, field or technology in medicine that has required innovation on so many levels at the same time.\" Precision is awaiting FDA approval to implant its chip in patients for up to 30 days. Rapoport expects the cost of a BCI to be six figures. \"For the economic impact on a young person, who has probably 50 years of life and maybe 35 years of work ahead of them, what you\\'re giving them and their family is a level of independence and economic self-sufficiency,\" Rapoport said. \"And that\\'s worth a year or two salary — I think most people would agree.\" Yasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Boston Scientific managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained. It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Boston Scientific achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 16% to US$16b. That's encouraging news for the company! In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Boston Scientific. Since Boston Scientific has a market capitalisation of US$128b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$239m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value. As previously touched on, Boston Scientific is a growing business, which is encouraging. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists.

Recommended Reading Why heart device makers are investing in left atrial appendage closure Boston Scientific’s Watchman left atrial appendage (LAA) closure device to prevent stroke resulted in significantly less bleeding after an ablation procedure than taking blood thinners, according to a new study. The trial, led by the Cleveland Clinic and funded by Boston Scientific, is the first to compare LAA closure to oral anticoagulants in patients who had an ablation procedure to treat atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular heartbeat that increases stroke risk. Both arms of the study had low rates of stroke, blood clots and death, which is good news for patients, Oussama Wazni, vice chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, told MedTech Dive. “The main takeaway is that now we have a choice after an ablation. When a patient is concerned about continuing oral anticoagulation, we have a choice of a device, and you won\\'t need to take blood thinners long-term,” said Wazni, the study\\'s principal investigator. The findings were presented Saturday at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. More patients with AFib are undergoing cardiac ablation to treat the condition, but guidelines recommend those at high risk for stroke remain on blood thinners afterward in case of AFib recurrence. However, long-term use of blood thinners poses a risk of serious bleeding. “Regardless of ablation or no ablation, 25% of patients who should be on a blood thinner stop taking it in a year for a variety of reasons,” including cost or bleeding, said Wazni. The Watchman implant closes the LAA to prevent clots from escaping and blocking blood flow to the brain. The study of 1,600 patients, called Option, showed the Watchman FLX device was non-inferior to oral anticoagulation, meeting its primary efficacy endpoint of death, stroke or embolism at three years. The rate of those events was 5.3% in the device group vs. 5.8% in the oral anticoagulation group. “The event rate was lower in the investigation on the device arm than oral anticoagulation,” Wazni said.” So it gives us a lot of confidence that it is truly non-inferior to blood thinners and equivalent to blood thinners in reducing the risk of stroke.” The data also met the primary safety endpoint of non-procedural major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. On that measure, the device demonstrated superiority to oral anticoagulation, at 8.5% vs. 18.1%. \"These positive primary outcomes mean that patients receiving the [Watchman] FLX device were able to eliminate long-term medication use while maintaining stroke protection,” Brad Sutton, chief medical officer for atrial fibrillation solutions at Boston Scientific, said in a statement Saturday. “With this data, we see potential to both expand the indication for the [Watchman] FLX platform and ultimately elevate it to become a frontline therapy for patients receiving cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation to reduce their risk of stroke.\" BTIG analyst Marie Thibault noted that Boston Scientific expects to receive a label expansion from the Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2025. “We believe these data support the use of Watchman to decrease the risk of long-term bleeding and manage the risk of stroke in post-ablation patients,” Thibault wrote in a note to clients Sunday. In addition to the Option trial, Watchman is being evaluated against direct oral anticoagulants as a first-line therapy in lower-risk patients in the Champion-AF trial, Boston Scientific said.'}\n",

Recommended Reading J&J wins FDA approval for Varipulse PFA system Competition in the fast-growing pulsed field ablation (PFA) market has intensified with the arrival of Johnson & Johnson’s Varipulse system and new heart mapping capabilities from Boston Scientific and Medtronic. J&J’s U.S. approval this month created a three-way race among the medtech heavyweights for PFA devices to treat atrial fibrillation (AFib), an abnormal heart rhythm. Each now also has integrated mapping for doctors to track the heart’s electrical activity during the procedure. A person with AFib may feel their heart quivering, pounding or skipping beats. The condition increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. Doctors are embracing PFA\\xa0to treat AFib amid evidence the approach can restore normal heart rhythm with fewer complications than traditional methods of cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation. PFA, which delivers electrical pulses to destroy the cardiac cells causing AFib, also enables faster procedure times. Less than a year after its U.S. debut, PFA “is quickly becoming the standard of care,” J.P. Morgan analysts wrote last month. PFA is already the preferred form of treatment in about a quarter of AFib ablation procedures, at the expense of cryoablation and radiofrequency energy, according to Stifel analysts. J&J, Boston Scientific and Abbott executives described a changing AFib treatment landscape on their third-quarter earnings calls. On Tuesday, Medtronic is expected to weigh in on early progress launching its second-generation PFA device, Affera, when it reports quarterly results. Here is where medtech companies stand in the rapidly evolving PFA market: In October, Boston Scientific unveiled Farawave Nav, a follow-up to its Farapulse system and the first mapping-integrated PFA catheter to hit the U.S. market. Farapulse launched in January, a month after Medtronic’s Pulseselect. Both companies have seen strong adoption for their initial offerings. Truist Securities in October predicted that by 2026, PFA would comprise about 60% of a global AFib market worth $8.2 billion, with Boston Scientific claiming at least half the share. Farapulse is driving a “transformative conversion” from radiofrequency and cryoablation thanks to excellent outcomes for patients and efficiencies for providers, Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney said on an October earnings call. Strong procedure volumes helped the company’s electrophysiology sales nearly triple in the third quarter. Farapulse is approved for people who have episodes of AFib that come and go, called paroxysmal AFib, and don’t respond well to medications. Boston Scientific has its sights on additional patient groups as well. One clinical trial underway is studying Farapulse in drug-refractory patients with persistent AFib lasting more than a week. Mahoney expects a label expansion for the indication in the second half of 2025. Boston Scientific is also evaluating the system as a first-line treatment for persistent AFib. Days after Boston Scientific won the nod for Farapulse Nav, Medtronic announced Food and Drug Administration authorization for its second PFA device, the Affera mapping and ablation system. Affera is indicated for persistent AFib and is the first catheter to combine mapping and a dual-energy option that allows physicians to switch between PFA and radiofrequency. Needham analysts called Affera a “considerably more formidable threat to Farapulse” and predicted the device would capture more market share than Medtronic’s Pulseselect system, which is approved to treat both paroxysmal and persistent AFib in drug-refractory patients. Medtronic has also begun to study Affera in patients with ventricular tachycardia, a form of arrhythmia that causes the heart to beat abnormally fast. J&J is now set to challenge Medtronic and Boston Scientific in the U.S. after getting the FDA’s go-ahead for Varipulse in drug-refractory, paroxysmal patients. The platform integrates with J&J’s Carto mapping system in a single device. Mapping integration could give J&J an edge, according to J.P. Morgan’s analysts, because many hospitals already have a Carto system. “J&J’s large existing presence in PFA could help drive share when it comes to market, especially in cases where mapping is needed,” the analysts said. More than half of competitors’ cases use J&J mapping, said J&J Medtech Chairman Tim Schmid, adding that the company’s $5 billion electrophysiology business is the sector leader. “That combination of the 5,500 installed base of Carto system\\'s best-in-class mapping and highly trained mappers, we believe, is a significant advantage and positions us extremely well when PFA comes to market,” Schmid said on an October call. Beyond Varipulse, J&J expects to develop a range of PFA catheters and has already applied for the CE mark in Europe for a dual-energy device, said Schmid. Abbott, which does not yet have a PFA system on the market, expects to file for FDA approval next year for its Volt device, CEO Robert Ford said on an October call. \"We\\'re very committed to being able to bring PFA to the market,” Ford said. Abbott also said last month it completed enrollment in its Volt U.S. clinical trial ahead of schedule. Enrollment in the Volt CE mark study was completed earlier this year. Like J&J, Abbott already has a large installed base of mapping systems that the company expects will bolster the appeal of its PFA option. With open cardiac mapping, Abbott’s electrophysiology business has benefited from the rollout of other PFA systems as procedure volumes rise, Ford said. Still, Abbott’s electrophysiology growth has been shy of the market overall, the CEO noted. Abbott has maintained that existing PFA technologies have limitations and is betting on a new device design, called “balloon in basket,” to improve the procedure. In addition to Volt, Abbott is developing a device that can deliver both PFA and radiofrequency energy.'}\n",

With AI models from startups like OpenAI, companies are offering natural language search capabilities to users that are cutting away Google's dominance in the Search market. Latest reports from news publication Bloomberg suggest that Google now faces added pressure with authorities in the US reportedly pushing the firm to spin off its Chrome browser business.

The measures are a byproduct of a multilayer case that the Justice Department has built against Google. The government won the first round in the case earlier this year, which sought to prove that the tech giant has a web search monopoly in the US. In the ruling on this case, federal judge Amit Mehta ruled that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets. Per the Justice Department, the case against Chrome stems from the fact that the browser is a key access point through which many people use Google Search.

Sometimes the social media site pushes posts to your feed that reflect something you’ve long since lost interest in. Other times, it just guesses wrong. Now Instagram is in the process of offering a “reset” button to give your feed a fresh start. Meta says it’s testing a way for people to get a clean slate in their Explore, Reels, and Feed. The feature is still being tested, but the company said it “will soon roll out globally.” Resetting will also allow users to review the accounts they are following and unfollow any that share content they no longer want to see. The new tool will not delete your data from the app or change how the company serves ads. Resetting suggestions on your feed is something most users might appreciate, but Meta is saying this change is a way to make the app safer for teen users. “We want to make sure everyone on Instagram—especially teens—has safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences and feels the time they’re spending on Instagram is valuable,” the company wrote in a blog post. “We want to give teens new ways to shape their Instagram experience, so it can continue to reflect their passions and interests as they evolve.” Instagram has been on the defensive about how it handles young users since a whistleblower leaked internal documents suggesting Facebook knowingly prioritized profit over well-being and safety. The controversy led to congressional testimony and spurred debate about what could be done to protect minors online. In October 2023, more than 30 U.S. states filed a lawsuit against Meta alleging harmful youth marketing. Two months ago, the company unveiled a new type of Instagram account for anyone under 16, with significantly more parental supervision tools. Current Instagram users who fall in the age range were automatically placed into the teen accounts as well. This story was originally featured on Fortune.com'}\n",

While there has been significant investment in artificial intelligence (AI) to automate this task, the reality is that human content moderators (CMs) still bear the brunt of this responsibility. CMs, often hired by third-party companies on behalf of major social media platforms like Facebook, TikTok, and Instagram, are tasked with reviewing and removing harmful online posts to protect users. Yet, the toll this job takes on them is significant and often overlooked. Human moderators face unique challenges in their day-to-day work. Their responsibilities range from analysing content with offensive language to disturbing imagery of violence and exploitation. They must navigate complex contextual decisions that involve empathy and understanding, which comes at a high cost as they are constantly exposed to distressing material. Studies have shown that jobs involving prolonged exposure to other people’s suffering can lead to conditions like secondary traumatic stress, emotional exhaustion, and psychological distress. Content moderation shares many of these risks and many CMs experience higher rates of mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. The problem is compounded by the high-stress environment of content moderation as moderators must make quick, high-stakes decisions on content that could impact the safety of millions of users globally. CMs uphold policies set by tech companies to remove harmful content, which requires continuous focus and a deep understanding of guidelines. The pressure leads to emotional exhaustion, burnout, and a general sense of apathy, and many moderators report feeling underappreciated and isolated. A landmark case involving Facebook (now Meta) in 2020 highlighted the reality of this distressing work environment. Facebook agreed to a $52m settlement to compensate moderators who developed mental health conditions because of their work. The case, brought forward by former moderator Selena Scola, highlighted the traumatic nature of content moderation. Despite the severity of these psychological issues, the industry is still reliant on human moderators. While AI offers hope as a tool for content moderation, its limitations are evident. Algorithms struggle with nuanced content, such as satire or culturally specific references, and may overlook harmful material or wrongly flag benign posts. Therefore, human oversight has remained necessary, despite the risks to mental health. At present, AI does not offer a comprehensive solution and the burden will remain on human moderators. Therefore, online platforms must focus on taking greater responsibility for protecting the mental health of their moderation team. Offering adequate mental health support, reducing workloads, and providing fair compensation are all important steps. Greater transparency about the working conditions of content moderation will also improve industry expectations and standards. As the internet continues to rely on their labour, the tech industry must prioritise the well-being of CMs to ensure the protection of the internet doesn’t come at the cost of those that moderate it. \"The human cost of moderating harmful online content\" was originally created and published by Verdict, a GlobalData owned brand.

This is an update from my Sept. 6 GuruFocus article, Meta Platforms is Down, But Not Out. At the time, META was at $500.27, and today it's $564.04. This article projects a price target of at least $668 per share. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META. My thesis is Meta's powerful free cash flow (FCF) could push META stock significantly higher. This article sets a price target based on the company's recent Q3 powerful free cash flow performance, analysts' revenue estimates, and management guidance, especially capex spending. Moreover, a FCF yield metric is the best way to value META stock, and we show how we derived that metric. The bottom line is META is worth up to 15% more, or $649 per share, based on its strong free cash flow. It could be worth much more in 2025, or $699 per share, +24%. This article will show how that could happen. Here is where things stand now with META stock. Meta stock price, Dividend, buyback, FCF yield and Total Shareholder Yield Meta Platform's produced strong growth in Q3 ending Sept. 30, 2024. Revenue was up 18.9% YoY and climbed 3.9% QoQ (this was after rising 22% YoY in Q2 and 7.2% QoQ). It also had strong viewer participation in Facebook and other sites. In Q3, it had 3.29 billion daily active people (DAP) in its family of products (including Instagram and What's App). That was up 0.6% from the prior quarter's 3.27 billion DAP stat. More importantly, this was 4.77% higher than a year earlier (3.14 billion DAP) and 12.3% over 2 years ago (2.93 billion DAP). Meta Q3 2024 Earnings slides page 10 This higher viewing audience has led to higher revenue forecasts, since most of the company's sales come from advertising. For example, analysts' 2024 projections are for $162.7 billion in sales this year, up from $158.5 billion earlier (see my prior article). Moreover, for 2025 analysts now project $186.3 billion in revenue, up from $178 billion just 3 months ago. The bottom line is that that more eyeballs on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is leading to over 20% sales growth this year and almost +15% in 2025. Meta revenue projections As a result, Meta's operating and free cash flow (FCF) is expected to grow significantly, despite higher capex spending FCF is measured as the cash flow remaining after all operating cash expenses, including working capital changes and capex spending. Meta Platforms also deducts principal payments on leases as an FCF adjustment (i.e., this lowers FCF). The chart above shows that Meta is forecast to make $52.9 billion in adj. FCF this year. That is works out to a 22.9% YoY growth rate over 2023. Moreover, its FCF margin of 32.5% on projected sales of $162.7 billion is higher than last year's 31.9% margin, despite higher sales and higher capex spending. Next year, Meta is forecast to have produce even stronger adj. FCF (+16.8% at $61.7 billion) Moreover, its adj. FCF margins will stay strong at 33.1%. This can be seen in the table below. Source: Hake model Note this adj. FCF will be higher despite significantly higher capex spending. Meta has raised its capex spending this quarter ($8.3 billion vs. $6.5 billion a year ago). It's planning even higher capex spending in Q4 and next year. Management told analysts in the earnings call (page 7 of the transcript) that its capex spending will be in the range of $38-40 billion, updated from our prior range of $37-40 billion. Moreover, for 2025, the company said we continue to expect significant capex growth in 2025. Management has consistently said this is to invest in its AI research and product development efforts. As a result, this was incorporated into my Meta cash flow model. Here is how our Meta Platforms model works. The 2024 $162.7 billion 2024 revenue estimate implies that Q4 revenue will be $46.5 billion (i.e., $162.7b 2024 - $116.1b Q1-Q3). Then let's assume Q4 would have a similar operating cash flow (OCF) margin as in Q3. The table below shows that in Q3 it was 60.9%, so to be conservative I used a 60% OCF margin for Q4. This results in an OCF forecast of $91.3 billion for 2024 (i.e., a 55.8% for the year). For 2025 this same 55.8% OCF margin was used against analysts' revenue estimates of $186.3 billion, resulting in OCF of $104 billio. Next, I assumed that capex spending will rise significantly in Q4 to $12.5 billion. This totals $35.3 billion for 2024, but incl. $3.05 billion in lease principal payments, the total deductions from OCF will be $38.39 billion. That is within the r38-$40 billion range that management mentioned. All of this can be seen in the table above. I assumed that capex spending will rise by 10% in 2025. As a result, total capex and lease principal payments will be $42.23 billion. The net result is that by 2025 Meta could generating $61.7 billion in adj. FCF, +16.8% over 2024 ($52.9 billion) and its FCF will rise to 33.1% - all despite significantly higher capex spending over 2023. To set a price target, these FCF estimates are applied against a FCF yield metric. This FCF yield metric assumes a 100% payout of its free cash flow in dividends. So, the value is set by using the company's historical FCF yield. For example, in the last 12 months (LTM) ending Sept. 30, Meta generated $50.45 billion in adj. FCF. Its dividend, which has a 0.355% yield, costs $5.05 billion, and represents 10.1% of its $50.45 billion in LTM adj. FCF.Therefore, taking the inverse of 10.1% (i.e., 1/0.101), or 10x, and multiplying it by the 0.35% dividend yield, this results in a 3.55% FCF yield: In other words, FCF yield assumes a 100% dividend payout and this implies a 3.55% FCF yield, given that its 0.355% yield today represents only 10% of its historical LTM FCF. Next, we apply this FCF yield metric against our forecast for FCF for the next two years. (Note I used a 3.50% FCF yield to round this metric down from 3.55%. But it is also the same, i.e., using an inverse, as multiplying FCF by 28.6x.): This shows that this year META could rise to $599 per share (close to $600) assuming our forecasts for Q4 operating cash flow margins and capex spending come true. That is a 6.1% gain in the stock. But by next year, assuming it achieves a similar OCF margin as in 2024, with even 10% higher capex spending, META stock could rise to $699 per share. The average price of both of these target prices is $649 per share, or +15% or so higher than today's price of $564 per share. This forecast could be too conservative. For one, I have not factored in the huge amount of share buybacks that the company is doing. For example, in the last 12 months (LTM) to Sept. 20, the company has spent over $48 billion on buybacks, or 95% of its FCF. As a result, so far this year, the number of shares has fallen by 1.43%, according to my calculations. Over time, that adds up. This works to an annual rate of 1.9% decline in shares outstanding. So, over the next 2 years, that could approach 4%. In other words, the stock could have a 4% higher valuation with the same assumptions I have made in my model. Secondly, the market could raise its valuation on META if free cash flow and FCF margins stay strong. This is despite the higher capex spending. In other words, the market might be willing to project that the company's huge AI spending will eventually pay off. This is important since even a small change in the FCF yield metric can have a huge effect on the stock price. For example, using a lower 3.0% FCF yield metric (i.e., 14.2% lower than the 3.50% FCF yield in my model) results in a price target of $698 this year and $815 in 2025, or $757 on average. That is 34% higher than today's price, or over twice my projected upside, for just a 14% change in the FCF metric. Lastly, analysts also believe META stock is undervalued. For example, AnaChart.com, a new sell-side analyst tracking site, shows that the average price target of 46 analysts today is $629.04 per share.That is 11.5% above today's price and close to my $649 target price. The bottom line is that Meta is too cheap here. Stick with this strong free cash gusher for the long term. This article first appeared on GuruFocus.\"}\n",

This is an update from my Sept. 6 GuruFocus article, Meta Platforms is Down, But Not Out. At the time, META was at $500.27, and today it's $564.04. This article projects a price target of at least $668 per share. Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META. My thesis is Meta's powerful free cash flow (FCF) could push META stock significantly higher. This article sets a price target based on the company's recent Q3 powerful free cash flow performance, analysts' revenue estimates, and management guidance, especially capex spending. Moreover, a FCF yield metric is the best way to value META stock, and we show how we derived that metric. The bottom line is META is worth up to 15% more, or $649 per share, based on its strong free cash flow. It could be worth much more in 2025, or $699 per share, +24%. This article will show how that could happen. Here is where things stand now with META stock. Meta stock price, Dividend, buyback, FCF yield and Total Shareholder Yield Meta Platform's produced strong growth in Q3 ending Sept. 30, 2024. Revenue was up 18.9% YoY and climbed 3.9% QoQ (this was after rising 22% YoY in Q2 and 7.2% QoQ). It also had strong viewer participation in Facebook and other sites. In Q3, it had 3.29 billion daily active people (DAP) in its family of products (including Instagram and What's App). That was up 0.6% from the prior quarter's 3.27 billion DAP stat. More importantly, this was 4.77% higher than a year earlier (3.14 billion DAP) and 12.3% over 2 years ago (2.93 billion DAP). Meta Q3 2024 Earnings slides page 10 This higher viewing audience has led to higher revenue forecasts, since most of the company's sales come from advertising. For example, analysts' 2024 projections are for $162.7 billion in sales this year, up from $158.5 billion earlier (see my prior article). Moreover, for 2025 analysts now project $186.3 billion in revenue, up from $178 billion just 3 months ago. The bottom line is that that more eyeballs on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp is leading to over 20% sales growth this year and almost +15% in 2025. Meta revenue projections As a result, Meta's operating and free cash flow (FCF) is expected to grow significantly, despite higher capex spending FCF is measured as the cash flow remaining after all operating cash expenses, including working capital changes and capex spending. Meta Platforms also deducts principal payments on leases as an FCF adjustment (i.e., this lowers FCF). The chart above shows that Meta is forecast to make $52.9 billion in adj. FCF this year. That is works out to a 22.9% YoY growth rate over 2023. Moreover, its FCF margin of 32.5% on projected sales of $162.7 billion is higher than last year's 31.9% margin, despite higher sales and higher capex spending.

Earlier this year, Instagram announced new privacy controls that let teen users choose the topics they want to see more regularly, such as books, travel, cooking or sports. Instagram already allows people to share whether they are interested in videos that are recommended to them, and takes into account other signals, like whether a person likes or shares a post, to help decide what to show them. Resetting the recommendation algorithm will also give users a chance to review the accounts they follow in case they wish to drop people. “We want to make sure everyone on Instagram — especially teens — has safe, positive, age-appropriate experiences and feels the time they’re spending on Instagram is valuable,” Meta wrote Tuesday in a blog post. “We want to give teens new ways to shape their Instagram experience, so it can continue to reflect their passions and interests as they evolve.” Meta has been recommending more content related to entertainment on Instagram, moving away from news and politics, as it seeks to increase the amount of time young people spend on its apps and avoid confrontational posts. The company has also been recommending more content from strangers, or people that users don’t already follow, as it tries to compete with ByteDance Ltd.-owned TikTok. TikTok’s algorithm, which is credited for the app’s swift rise, is known for its ability to help people go “viral” by recommending their content to people that don’t already follow them. More than 1 billion people worldwide use TikTok, many of them teenagers who spend hours each day watching video content. Last year, TikTok also introduced a feature to let users reset their video feeds, along with an update that showed teens less potentially harmful content, such as videos related to sadness, extreme dieting or sexually suggestive topics.

The group posted strong growth, though post-earnings reactions weren’t favorable for all. But reports from Tesla TSLA and Amazon AMZN did spark post-earnings positivity, with shares of each seeing positive price action following their releases. But what was there to like in each respective release? Let’s take a closer look.  Concerning headline figures in Amazon’s quarterly release, the company exceeded both consensus EPS and sales expectations handily. EPS grew a sizable 70% year-over-year, whereas sales of $60 billion reflected an 11% climb from the year-ago period. However, the real highlight of the results was the AWS results. AWS sales jumped 19% year-over-year to $27.5 billion, matching the same growth pace we saw last quarter. While the growth pace didn’t reflect an acceleration, the results overall confirm underlying momentum. Further, the profitability picture for AWS jumped higher, with operating income of $9.3 billion well above the $5.4 billion mark in the year-ago period. Below is a\\xa0chart illustrating the company’s AWS results against our consensus expectations, with the recent $27.5 billion print falling $127 million short. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Like Tesla, analysts raised their earnings expectations for Amazon following the favorable release, with the stock boasting a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Overall, the company’s dominant stance in the cloud paints a bright outlook for the company, particularly in the midst of this AI frenzy that we’ve all become accustomed to. AWS is the dominant player in the cloud computing market, flexing a significant market share globally. It provides various services, including computing power, storage, databases, and AI/ML tools.  While EV delivery/production numbers were important, the real highlight of the release that caused shares to perk up was margin expansion, with the company’s gross margin expanding nicely to 19.8% vs. a 17.9% print in the same period last year. Please note that the chart’s values are calculated on a trailing twelve-month basis. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Notably, Tesla reported its lowest-ever level of cost of goods sold (COGS) per vehicle throughout the period, which bodes favorably for upcoming periods as well. Analysts have raised their EPS expectations across the board following the release, with the stock now holding the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The stock’s current momentum is undeniable, partly boosted by the recent U.S. election. Growth is expected to resume in its next fiscal year, with our consensus FY25 expectations suggesting 30% EPS growth on 16% higher sales. Bottom Line With Nvidia's quarterly release finally out of the way, the Q3 reporting cycle for the broader Mag 7 group has ended. The group overall posted strong growth, though Amazon AMZN and Tesla TSLA were among the few to see post-earnings momentum. A notable boost in profitability helped vault Tesla shares higher, with the stock also benefiting from the recent U.S. election. The company overall remains the prime selection for EV exposure, with growth expected to return in a big way during its next fiscal year. A strong showing from AWS in Amazon’s release aided the bullish action post-earnings, with the results reflecting underlying momentum. The company remains a solid pick for the AI frenzy given its dominant cloud computing stance, with an upcoming holiday season also potentially providing near-term tailwinds.

If President-elect Donald Trump and his team repeal the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs, as reported, the fallout will be massive. The Biden administration’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, introduced the $7,500 EV tax credit for consumer vehicles and numerous others for commercial EVs and battery production, among other things. Since the law’s inception in 2022, EV sales have taken off. In 2023, the first full year of the credit, EV sales jumped 46% year over year to 1.19 million, compared to 813,000 in 2022, according to Cox’s Kelly Blue Book. Last month in a new report dubbed “The Effects of ‘Buy American’: Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act, researchers Joseph Shapiro, Hunt Allcott, and Felix Tintelnot quantified the tax credit effect. After constructing a model and running a simulation, the report found that EV sales in the US would drop 27% if the federal EV tax credit were removed, compared to a scenario with the EV tax credit in place. The report found this would lead to EV registrations falling to 867,000 EVs from 1.184 million with the tax credit in place — or 317,000 fewer EVs. Bloomberg News was first to highlight the results of this report. “This specific scenario is take summer of 2023, take all the conditions — supply, demand, and take away the EV tax credits — how would sales fall?” Joseph Shapiro, UC Berkeley associate professor of economics and co-author of the report, told Yahoo Finance. With EV sales growing nearly 40% year over year last year, losing the EV tax credit is a \"substantial change,\" Shapiro said. \"It\\'s a rapidly growing market and relatively new technology, but [loss of the EV tax credit] is not trivial. I mean, $7,500 is not trivial,” Shapiro added. But there are caveats here. Shapiro notes that while a 27% decrease is substantial, relative to what sales would be otherwise, it may not be that big of a deal. EV sales increased over 40% year on year in 2023, meaning sales could be at a “flatline” if the tax credit were repealed. That being said, sales for this year are only trending up 10% year over year through Q3, according to Kelley Blue Book, indicating a significant impact, assuming sales trend at the same level in Q4. While repealing the tax credit would be damaging to near-term EV sales, there are possible ways to refine its effects for the better. Shapiro and his co-authors also noted that the federal EV tax credit as constructed is not very efficient. One alternative: different subsidies for different vehicles. Certain bigger EVs create “large negative externalities” — meaning they\\'re more likely to have fatal accidents in addition to high energy use. Smaller EVs get the same tax credit benefit despite being lightweight, better for safety, and demanding much less electricity. “We\\'re giving the same $7,500 subsidy to most of those vehicles, and giving smaller subsidies to cars that have larger costs to society, larger externalities, that would make these subsidies more beneficial to society overall,” Shapiro said. Tweaks, if any, will be down the road, and that path is uncertain, given Trump\\'s team is still in the process of being formed. For now, EV makers will probably have to deal with some potential bad news, with research showing over 300,000 fewer EVs sold with tax credit repeal. Wall Street predicts automakers will have to find ways to pick up the slack somewhere — perhaps cutting into profits with deeper discounts. “All else equal, a removal of incentives would make EVs significantly more expensive, adding downward pressure to out-year volumes, assuming [original equipment manufacturers] do not compensate with incremental discounting,” Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas wrote in a note earlier this week. Jonas and Morgan Stanley believe Lucid (LCID), Rivian (RIVN), and Tesla (TSLA) are “most exposed” to the loss of the tax credit. In the long run, Morgan Stanley predicts that EV adoption will not slow, despite short-term hiccups. “While a slowing of EV adoption can provide valuable time for some legacy players to catch up, we still expect EV penetration to keep rising long term as innovation and scale will bring lower cost and higher performance products in the long term,” Jonas wrote.

In a late-night post on Wednesday, the Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX CEO claimed that Bezos had warned “everyone” to sell off stock in his companies if Vice President Kamala Harris won the 2024 presidential election. Musk made a major bet — which appears to have paid off — that President-elect Donald Trump would win, repeatedly making claims that a Harris administration would seek retribution from him. “Just learned tonight at Mar-a-Lago that Jeff Bezos was telling everyone that @realDonaldTrump would lose for sure, so they should sell all their Tesla and SpaceX stock,” Musk wrote on X, the social media platform he owns, adding an emoji at the end. There’s just one problem with Musk’s claim. According to Bezos, who would likely benefit from a federal government opposed to Musk, it’s utterly false. “Nope. 100% not true,” Bezos said in a rare post on X. He’s posted on the platform just four times in 2024, including writing a message earlier this month congratulating Trump on his victory and a statement following the first attempted assassination on the then-Republican candidate for president. It’s the latest shot fired in the rivalry between the two tech leaders, who are the first and second richest individuals in the world, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index. Musk’s net worth has hit $331 billion after Tesla’s stock boomed following Trump’s victory, and his xAI and SpaceX are reportedly eyeing major valuation surges. Bezos is worth $226 billion, largely thanks to his Amazon (AMZN) holdings. Musk’s SpaceX is a dominant force in the aerospace industry, while Bezos’ Blue Origin is building itself into a rival. This week, NASA asked both companies to develop cargo landers to deliver equipment to the Moon as part of its Artemis missions. The two firms and the United Launch Alliance, a joint venture from Boeing (BA) and Lockheed Martin (LMT), will be fighting for national security space mission contracts over the next five years. Blue Origin has previously protested a contract NASA gave SpaceX and sought to limit SpaceX’s Starship launches, while Amazon’s Kuiper has opposed SpaceX’s plans to expand its Starlink satellite network. In 2020, Musk called for the government to break up Amazon, complaining about monopolies. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.'}\n",

Despite being labeled an “outside of government” group by President-elect Donald Trump, the two say that DOGE will work closely with Congress and the executive branch. The group aims to drastically slash federal spending and regulations, with Musk pointing to a target of $2 trillion in cost-cutting. Ramaswamy, a former presidential candidate and billionaire entrepreneur, has said he expects “certain agencies to be deleted outright.” In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal (NWSA), the duo said Wednesday that they would “serve as outside volunteers, not federal officials or employees,” a distinction intended to allow the businessmen to retain their financial interests. Musk is the CEO of SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA), which have received billions of dollars in government contracts, and the executive has several other companies also regulated by federal agencies. Musk and Ramaswamy wrote that they are working with the Trump transition team to hire a team of “small-government crusaders.” Last week, DOGE began accepting applications delivered through direct messages on the social media site X, seeking to hire individuals willing to work more than 80 hours per week. “This team will work in the new administration closely with the White House Office of Management and Budget,” they wrote. It’s still unclear exactly how they will formally establish DOGE. Besides working with the federal agency that manages the president’s budget, DOGE could have influence in the House of Representatives. House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer is expected to launch a subcommittee—chaired by controversial Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene—that will work with DOGE, Fox News reports. “I’m excited to chair this new subcommittee designed to work hand in hand with President Trump, Elon Musk, Vivek Ramaswamy and the entire DOGE team,” Greene told Fox. “We will identify and investigate the waste, corruption and absolutely useless parts of our federal government.” As for the source of those cuts, DOGE is eyeing headcount reductions, federal spending “being used in ways that Congress never intended,” and regulations deemed wasteful by the duo. In the opinion piece, the DOGE leaders named a few targets. Musk and Ramaswamy said they would chop funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. The group was founded by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 and has supported the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio, which Musk and other conservatives often criticize. The DOGE leaders also hope to cut funding for Planned Parenthood, a nonprofit that provides reproductive and sexual health services. Much of the nonprofit’s funding comes from government reimbursements and grants. DOGE will also work with legal experts at government agencies to apply recent rulings and hand Trump a list of regulations they would like him to freeze through executive order. The group will tackle how agencies order goods and services, writing that large-scale audits would “yield significant savings,” pointing to the Pentagon’s latest failed audit. As for federal workers, Musk and Ramaswamy plan to work with government agencies to identify the minimum number of staffers needed for departments to “perform its constitutionally permissible and statutorily mandated functions.” They float recommending Trump issue incentives for early retirement or voluntary buyouts. “Not only are fewer employees required to enforce fewer regulations, but the agency would produce fewer regulations once its scope of authority is properly limited,” they wrote. “Employees whose positions are eliminated deserve to be treated with respect, and DOGE’s goal is to help support their transition into the private sector.” Trump’s pick to lead the Health and Human Services Department, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., has suggested big cuts at the department, including issuing mass layoffs. The president-elect has pledged to dismantle the Department of Education, a long-standing conservative goal. That department employs 4,400 people, according to its website. For the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.'}\n",

That would be the third-biggest harvest on record, and is about 1 million tons higher that what the group was expecting in September, when a lack of spring rain was threatening output. An unexpected increase in wheat exports from Australia may help alleviate concerns about potential disruptions to shipments from the Black Sea region as the war in Ukraine intensifies. Wheat futures are on track for their biggest weekly gain in two months due to nervousness over the escalating conflict. Wheat crops are yielding more than expected, said agronomist and GIWA report writer Michael Lamond, who lives on a farm on the western rim of the grain belt. “The leaves didn’t look to great prior to harvest, with damaged and yellowing leaves. But they’re yielding well.” The Western Australian harvest has, however, been delayed by heavy rain this week.

The system also can handle more sophisticated requests in a quicker fashion, they said. Revamping the 13-year-old Siri service is part of Apple’s efforts to become a force in artificial intelligence. The company debuted its much-ballyhooed Apple Intelligence platform last month, but it still lacks many of the features offered by other tech giants. The new voice assistant, which will eventually be added to Apple Intelligence, is dubbed “LLM Siri” by those working on it. LLMs — a building block of generative AI — gorge on massive amounts of data in order to identify patterns and answer questions. Apple has been testing the upgraded software on iPhones, iPads and Macs as a separate app, but the technology will ultimately replace the Siri interface that users rely on today. The company is planning to announce the overhaul as soon as 2025 as part of the upcoming iOS 19 and macOS 16 software updates, which are internally named Luck and Cheer, the people said. Like Apple Intelligence this fall, the new features won’t immediately be included in next year’s crop of hardware devices. Instead, Apple is currently planning to release the new Siri to consumers as early as spring 2026, about a year and a half from now. Given that Apple is still several months away from announcing the plan, the timing and features could still shift. A spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment. The revamped Siri will rely on new Apple AI models to interact more like a human and handle tasks in a way that’s closer to ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini. It also will make expanded use of App Intents, which allow for more precise control of third-party apps. And the software will be able to tap into features from Apple Intelligence, such as the ability to write and summarize text. Though Apple heralded “the start of a new era” for Siri when it first unveiled its AI platform in June, the company has yet to truly overhaul the software. The upgrades that accompanied Apple Intelligence were mostly cosmetic, including a new glowing interface that shows users when they’ve triggered the assistant. There’s also an option to type commands — rather than speaking them — and the ability to better understand users. Siri will get additional tweaks in the coming months as part of iOS 18, the iPhone’s current operating system. The software will be able to draw on customer data to provide context for commands and take action using the information on a user’s screen. The iOS 18 version relies on a first-generation Apple LLM to determine if requests should use the existing Siri infrastructure or be routed to a second LLM that can handle more complex queries and tap into third-party apps. The next-generation LLM planned for iOS 19 will be a new, end-to-end system that provides more advanced, ChatGPT-like capabilities. While the company works on that new technology, it will add ChatGPT to Apple Intelligence next month. Later, Apple plans to offer additional chatbot options, such as Gemini. The idea behind the new Siri is to bring these kinds of capabilities in-house, while emphasizing user privacy. But the company could still continue to offer access to third-party AI systems that provide specialized abilities or information. In recent weeks, Apple has posted job listings that hint at its plan for a more conversational Siri. “You will join a team that is redefining computing, creating groundbreaking conversational assistant technologies for both large-scale systems and new client devices, and with the people who built the intelligent assistants,” one listing reads. Others ask for candidates with knowledge in conversational AI interfaces and underlying technologies. Apple has been looking to give Siri more conversational abilities for several years but struggled to find the right technology. Over a year ago, Apple moved the team responsible for the way Siri interacts with users from the company’s AI division to its group responsible for software interfaces. The team is now led by Alan Dye, the company’s vice president of human interface design.

If President-elect Donald Trump and his team repeal the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs, as reported, the fallout will be massive. The Biden administration’s signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, introduced the $7,500 EV tax credit for consumer vehicles and numerous others for commercial EVs and battery production, among other things. Since the law’s inception in 2022, EV sales have taken off. In 2023, the first full year of the credit, EV sales jumped 46% year over year to 1.19 million, compared to 813,000 in 2022, according to Cox’s Kelly Blue Book. Last month in a new report dubbed “The Effects of ‘Buy American’: Electric Vehicles and the Inflation Reduction Act, researchers Joseph Shapiro, Hunt Allcott, and Felix Tintelnot quantified the tax credit effect. After constructing a model and running a simulation, the report found that EV sales in the US would drop 27% if the federal EV tax credit were removed, compared to a scenario with the EV tax credit in place. The report found this would lead to EV registrations falling to 867,000 EVs from 1.184 million with the tax credit in place — or 317,000 fewer EVs. Bloomberg News was first to highlight the results of this report. “This specific scenario is take summer of 2023, take all the conditions — supply, demand, and take away the EV tax credits — how would sales fall?” Joseph Shapiro, UC Berkeley associate professor of economics and co-author of the report, told Yahoo Finance. With EV sales growing nearly 40% year over year last year, losing the EV tax credit is a \"substantial change,\" Shapiro said. \"It\\'s a rapidly growing market and relatively new technology, but [loss of the EV tax credit] is not trivial. I mean, $7,500 is not trivial,” Shapiro added. But there are caveats here. Shapiro notes that while a 27% decrease is substantial, relative to what sales would be otherwise, it may not be that big of a deal. EV sales increased over 40% year on year in 2023, meaning sales could be at a “flatline” if the tax credit were repealed. That being said, sales for this year are only trending up 10% year over year through Q3, according to Kelley Blue Book, indicating a significant impact, assuming sales trend at the same level in Q4. While repealing the tax credit would be damaging to near-term EV sales, there are possible ways to refine its effects for the better. Shapiro and his co-authors also noted that the federal EV tax credit as constructed is not very efficient. One alternative: different subsidies for different vehicles. Certain bigger EVs create “large negative externalities” — meaning they\\'re more likely to have fatal accidents in addition to high energy use. Smaller EVs get the same tax credit benefit despite being lightweight, better for safety, and demanding much less electricity. “We\\'re giving the same $7,500 subsidy to most of those vehicles, and giving smaller subsidies to cars that have larger costs to society, larger externalities, that would make these subsidies more beneficial to society overall,” Shapiro said. Tweaks, if any, will be down the road, and that path is uncertain, given Trump\\'s team is still in the process of being formed. For now, EV makers will probably have to deal with some potential bad news, with research showing over 300,000 fewer EVs sold with tax credit repeal. Wall Street predicts automakers will have to find ways to pick up the slack somewhere — perhaps cutting into profits with deeper discounts. “All else equal, a removal of incentives would make EVs significantly more expensive, adding downward pressure to out-year volumes, assuming [original equipment manufacturers] do not compensate with incremental discounting,” Morgan Stanley’s Adam Jonas wrote in a note earlier this week. Jonas and Morgan Stanley believe Lucid (LCID), Rivian (RIVN), and Tesla (TSLA) are “most exposed” to the loss of the tax credit. In the long run, Morgan Stanley predicts that EV adoption will not slow, despite short-term hiccups. “While a slowing of EV adoption can provide valuable time for some legacy players to catch up, we still expect EV penetration to keep rising long term as innovation and scale will bring lower cost and higher performance products in the long term,” Jonas wrote.

For the quarter, Lucid reported revenue of $200 million, topping estimates of $196.3 million as compiled by Bloomberg and significantly more than the $137.8 million reported a year ago. Lucid posted an adjusted loss per share of $0.28, narrower than the loss of $0.31 expected, with adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) coming in at a loss of $613.1 million, better than the loss of $634.4 million expected. Earlier, Lucid reported it had produced 1,805 vehicles in Q3, with deliveries coming in at 2,781. The company said today that it was on track to hit its annual production guidance of 9,000 vehicles. Lucid stock was up 3% in early trade on Friday. “Our momentum continues with our third consecutive quarter of record deliveries,” Peter Rawlinson, Lucid CEO and chief technology officer, said in a statement. “Additionally, today we are delighted to open the order book for the much-anticipated Lucid Gravity SUV, a landmark product, which remains on track for the start of production this year.\" The company also said it ended the quarter with $5.16 billion in cash — an important runway as the company begins production of the Gravity. This does not include the approximately $1.75 billion it raised in a share sale earlier last month. “We continue to see improvements to gross margin performance as our cost reduction efforts are gaining momentum,” said Gagan Dhingra, Lucid’s interim CFO, in a statement. “With our recent capital raise, we are pleased to have the continued support once again from both the Public Investment Fund and other institutional investors.” Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF), through its affiliate Ayar Third Investment Company, is Lucid’s largest investor. Ayar purchased additional shares during the capital raise to maintain its 58.8% stake. Lucid hopes its upcoming Gravity SUV, expected to begin production later this year, will jump-start sales by a significant margin. “We believe that the total addressable market for Gravity is six times that of Lucid Air,” Rawlinson said in an interview with Yahoo Finance in August. Rawlinson said the company will eventually have capacity at its Arizona plant to build 90,000 Gravity SUVs per year. The big question will be whether Lucid can build the Gravity SUV efficiently and come in below cost. The Gravity is expected to start around $80,000 in the US, right at the eligibility threshold for the federal EV tax credit. Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look. The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits. Currently, Pfizer has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Novo Nordisk has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). This means that PFE's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors. PFE currently has a forward P/E ratio of 8.57, while NVO has a forward P/E of 32.52. We also note that PFE has a PEG ratio of 0.80. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. NVO currently has a PEG ratio of 1.35. Another notable valuation metric for PFE is its P/B ratio of 1.53. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, NVO has a P/B of 26.59. These are just a few of the metrics contributing to PFE's Value grade of A and NVO's Value grade of C. PFE sticks out from NVO in both our Zacks Rank and Style Scores models, so value investors will likely feel that PFE is the better option right now.

As soon as other investors start selling their stocks at a cheaper rate in times of market uncertainty, value investors take this as an opportunity to pick good stocks at a discounted price. Several stocks that have surged significantly in the recent past have shown the overwhelming success of this pure-play investment strategy. Here, we discuss five such stocks — Ingredion Incorporated INGR, Pfizer PFE, Leidos LDOS, LATAM Airlines Group LTM and Alibaba Group BABA. However, this simple value investment technique has some drawbacks, and not properly understanding the strategy may often lead to “value traps.” In such a situation, these value picks start to underperform over the long run when the temporary problems, which once drove the share price down, turn out to be persistent. There are many value investment yardsticks, such as dividend yield, P/E or P/B, which are simple and can single out whether a stock is trading at a discount. However, for investors looking to escape such value traps, it is also vital to determine where the stock will be headed in the next 12 to 24 months. Warren Buffett advises these investors to focus on the earnings growth potential of a stock. This is where the importance of a not-so-popular value investing metric, the PEG ratio, lies. The PEG ratio is defined as (Price/ Earnings)/Earnings Growth Rate A low PEG ratio is always better for value investors. While P/E alone fails to identify a true value stock, PEG helps find the intrinsic value of a stock. There are some drawbacks to using the PEG ratio. It does not consider the common situation of changing growth rates, such as the forecast of the first three years at a very high growth rate, followed by a sustainable but lower growth rate over the long term. Hence, PEG-based investing can turn out to be even more rewarding if some other relevant parameters are also taken into consideration. Here are some of the screening criteria for a winning strategy: PEG Ratio less than X Industry Median P/E Ratio (using F1) less than X Industry Median (for more accurate valuation purposes) Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) (Whether good market conditions or bad, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1\\xa0or 2 have a proven history of success.) Market Capitalization greater than $1 Billion (This helps us focus on companies that have strong liquidity.) Average 20-Day Volume greater than 50,000 (A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.) Percentage Change F1 Earnings Estimate Revisions (4 Weeks) greater than 5% (Upward estimate revisions add to the optimism, suggesting further bullishness.) Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1, 2 or 3 (Hold), offer the best upside potential. Here are five of the 18 stocks that qualified the screening: Ingredion: Headquartered in Chicago, the company is a leading global ingredient solutions provider serving customers in more than 120 countries. With 2023 annual net sales of nearly $8 billion, Ingredion turns grains, fruits, vegetables and other plant-based materials into value-added ingredient solutions for the food, beverage, animal nutrition, brewing and industrial markets. Ingredioncurrently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Value Score of A. INGR also has an impressive five-year expected growth rate of 11%. Pfizer: The NY-based company markets a wide range of drugs and vaccines. Pfizer’s Biopharma reporting segment includes three broad therapeutic areas — Primary Care (Internal Medicine, Vaccines, Migraine and COVID-19 products), Specialty Care (Inflammation & Immunology, Rare Disease and Hospital [excluding Paxlovid]) and Oncology. Apart from a discounted PEG and P/E, PFE currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A. Pfizer has a long-term expected growth rate of 10.7%. Leidos: The Delaware-based company is a global science and technology leader that serves the defense, intelligence, civil and health markets. Its core capabilities include providing solutions in the fields of cybersecurity; data analytics; enterprise IT modernization; operations and logistics; sensors, collection and phenomenology; software development; and systems engineering.

Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have advanced 14.7%, 24.8%, and 28.6%, respectively. Despite this strong northbound movement, a long list of stocks significantly lagged this year. Nevertheless, an interesting observation is that a handful of these laggards, providing double-digit negative returns year to date, have the potential to return double-digit gains in the short term. Five such stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank are Adobe Inc. , Pfizer Inc., Dollar General Corp., Snap Inc. and Ryanair Holdings plc. These five laggards of this year have double-digit upside left for the rest of 2024. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. Adobe Inc. Zacks Rank #2 Adobe has extensively implemented AI applications across its flagship products, such as Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, and Premiere. Earlier this year, ADBE introduced generative AI-driven Adobe Firefly. Moreover, Adobe Acrobat and Reader AI Assistant help users summarize documents and answer questions, saving time and helping users accomplish tasks faster. Using its new AI-driven cloud-based platform, ADBE is also diversifying into digital marketing services, offering data mining services that help businesses measure page views, purchases and social media sites. Adobe Marketing Cloud enables marketers to deliver personalized web experiences across multiple devices, manage multichannel campaigns and optimize media monetization. ADBE has launched Adobe Express, an application for quick editing effects. Leveraging generative AI, this tool is useful for short-form video content like Instagram Reels. Adobe also launched an AI-based Express app for iOS and Android. The stock price has plummeted 16.2% year to date. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 22% from the last closing price of $499.61. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $440-$703. This indicates a maximum upside of 40.7% and a maximum downside of 12%. Pfizer Inc. Pfizer’s non-COVID operational revenue growth is improving, driven by its key in-line products like Prevnar, Vyndaqel and Eliquis, new launches, and newly acquired products, including those from Seagen. Although revenues from PFE’s COVID-19 products are declining due to lower demand, huge profits from COVID products have strengthened its cash position. The funds are being used to make acquisitions, increase dividends, buy back shares and reduce debt. Seagen’s acquisition has strengthened PFE’s position in the oncology market. Continued growth in non-COVID sales and significant cost-reduction measures should drive PFE’s profit growth. The stock price has dropped 12.8% year to date. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 29.1% from the last closing price of $25.10. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $25-$45. This indicates a maximum upside of 79.3% and no downside. Dollar General Corp. Dollar General remains a compelling growth story in the retail space, despite immediate margin pressure and a tough consumer environment. Thanks to its value-creating initiatives, defensive product mix and real estate growth strategy, DG has the capability to gain market share. DG’s commitment to better pricing, private label offerings, effective inventory management and merchandise initiative should drive sales. We remain encouraged by the host of initiatives such as DG Fresh, SKU rationalization, digitization and the expansion of private fleets that should yield same-store sales improvements and margin expansion. The company emphasizes maintaining and improving cash flow in 2024. Mirroring this optimism is our expectation of same-store sales growth of 1.2% and 1.9% for the current and next fiscal year, respectively. The stock price has plunged 43.7% year to date. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 24.8% from the last closing price of $76.50. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $73-$125. This indicates a maximum upside of 63.4% and a maximum downside of 4.6%. Snap Inc. Snap reported strong third-quarter 2024 results. Solid daily active user growth was attributed to the steady adoption of Augmented Reality Lenses, Spotlight and AI chatbot. The Snapchat+ subscription service reached more than 12 million paying subscribers in the third quarter. SNAP made considerable progress in diversifying revenues with Snapchat+ through new artificial intelligence-enabled features. SNAP authorized a new share repurchase program of $500 million. We expect 2024 net sales to rise 15.4% from 2023. The stock price has collapsed 37.9% year to date. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 24.6% from the last closing price of $10.51. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $8-$18. This indicates a maximum upside of 71.3% and a maximum downside of 23.9%. Ryanair Holdings plc Ryanair Holdings provides scheduled-passenger airline services in Ireland, the United Kingdom, Spain, Italy, and internationally. RYAAY’s measures to expand its fleet, to cater to rising travel demand, look encouraging. The passenger volume has been robust at Ryanair over the past few months owing to the rebound in air-traffic from COVID-19 lows. RYAAY is also involved in the provision of various ancillary services, such as non-flight scheduled and Internet-related services, as well as in-flight sale of beverages, food, duty-free, and merchandise, and markets car hire, travel insurance, and accommodation services through its website and mobile app. The stock price has tumbled 15.6% year to date. The average short-term price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 27.3% from the last closing price of $45.02. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $52-$62. This indicates a maximum upside of 37.7% and a maximum downside of 15.5%. Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year. Today you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.

With this nod, the once-weekly Hympavzi gets approved for routine prophylaxis (RP) to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes in patients aged 12 years and older with hemophilia A or B, without inhibitors to Factor VIII (FVIII) or Factor IX (FIX). Following this approval, Hympavzi became the first hemophilia medicine approved in the United States to be administered via a pre-filled, auto-injector pen. This approval was expected as the European Medicines Agency's (“EMA”) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) issued a positive opinion recommending Hympavzi’s approval in the above indication in September. The EC and CHMP decisions are based on data from the phase III BASIS study, which evaluated Hympavzi in hemophilia patients over a 12-month period. The study achieved its primary endpoint — treatment with the drug achieved statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in annualized bleeding rate (ABR) compared with the current standard-of-care treatment for hemophilia patients. Based on these results, the FDA approved this drug for a similar indication last month. Hemophilia, a rare genetic blood disorder, is caused by a missing clotting protein (FVIII in case of hemophilia A and FIX in case of hemophilia B), which prevents normal blood clotting. If the blood does not clot properly, it can lead to painful bleeding inside the joints that can cause scarring and damage. Per Pfizer, Hympavzi targets tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), which is a natural anticoagulation protein that functions to prevent the formation of blood clots. Year to date, shares of Pfizer have lost 13.4% against the industry’s 3.1% growth. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The latest decision marks the second EC approval for Pfizer this year in the hemophilia space. Earlier in July, the FDA approved Durveqtix (fidanacogene elaparvovec), the company’s one-shot gene therapy for hemophilia B. This gene therapy also received approval for a similar use by the FDA in April, where it is marketed under the brand name Beqvez. Apart from Durveqtix/Beqvez and Hympavzi, Pfizer is also developing an investigational one-time gene therapy for hemophilia A called giroctocogene fitelparvovec. In July, Pfizer reported positive results from the late-stage AFFINE study, which showed that treatment with the hemophilia A gene therapy led to a statistically significant reduction in ABR compared to the pre-infusion period. Like Hympavzi, Novo Nordisk NVO also developed its anti-TFPI inhibitor, concizumab, for treating hemophilia A and B with inhibitors. Last year, NVO received a complete response letter (CRL) from the FDA on the regulatory filing for concizumab in hemophilia A or B patients. Per the CRL, the agency requested additional data from Novo Nordisk on the drug’s administration and manufacturing process. Last month, the EMA’s CHMP recommended approving Novo’s drug to treat patients aged 12 years or older living with hemophilia A or B with inhibitors. The NVO drug is already approved for use in Canada and Japan since last year, where it is marketed under the brand name Alhemo. Beqvez faces direct competition from Hemgenix, which was approved by the FDA in 2022 as the first gene therapy for treating hemophilia B in adults aged 18 years and older. This gene therapy was developed by uniQure QURE in partnership with CSL Behring, a subsidiary of CSL Limited. The clinical development program for Hemgenix was initially led by uniQure, which was subsequently transferred to CSL after it acquired global rights to commercialize the treatment. BioMarin Pharmaceuticals’ BMRN Roctavian (valoctocogene roxaparvovec, or valrox) is the first and only gene therapy for hemophilia A, which was approved by\\xa0the FDA last year after a series of delays and rejections. The BioMarin therapy was initially approved in the EU in August 2022. In a separate press release, Pfizer announced that it has appointed Dr. Chris Boshoff as the chief scientific officer and president, Research & Development. He will succeed Dr. Mikael Dolsten, whose departure was announced earlier this year. This new appointment will be effective from Jan. 1, 2025. Dr. Boshoff currently serves as the chief oncology officer and executive vice president of the company. Pfizer Inc. price | Pfizer Inc. Quote Pfizer currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Sometimes, those issues are deeply damaging to a corporation's investment thesis. Other times, though, that's not the case, and the price drop represents a great buying opportunity for long-term investors. There are always companies in the second category on the market; it's just a matter of finding them. For those looking for great candidates, here are two in the healthcare sector: Merck (NYSE: MRK) and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). Neither has performed well this year, but both could reward patient investors down the road. Start Your Mornings Smarter!\\xa0Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.\\xa0Sign Up For Free » Is Merck's Keytruda empire crumbling? The company's famous cancer drug is by far its biggest growth driver and typically accounts for over 40% of its revenue. However, in September, Summit Therapeutics, a clinical-stage biotech, reported that a medicine called ivonescimab performed better than Keytruda in a phase 3 study conducted in China on patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a PD-L1 protein overexpression. NSCLC is Keytruda's most important market. This result, albeit from a Chinese study, suggests that the blockbuster medicine could soon face serious competition. Investors are rightly worried, but there is more to the story. First, ivonescimab just started late-stage studies in the U.S. It will take a couple of years (at least) before the medicine earns approval in the country, if it goes that far. In the meantime, Keytruda should continue its march forward. Second, Merck's crown jewel was set to face a patent cliff by 2028 anyway. Even if ivonescimab is approved in the U.S. in two years, by the time it takes significant market share away from Keytruda, its patent exclusivity may have expired. True, Merck's goal is to develop a subcutaneous version of Keytruda that will earn many of the same indications and extend its patent life beyond 2028. So, ivonescimab could still be a threat. Merck agrees. The company recently penned a licensing agreement with China-based LaNova Medicines for an investigational therapy called LM-299. Like ivonescimab, LM-299 is a bispecific antibody, a newer class of cancer drugs that could prove more effective than the older checkpoint inhibitors, the category to which Keytruda belongs. Merck's licensing agreement with LaNova shows it isn't resting on its laurels. It will seek to remain a force in oncology. Elsewhere, Merck continues to deliver decent financial results and earn brand-new approvals. In the third quarter, the company's revenue increased by 4% year over year to $16.7 billion. Earlier this year, it earned approval for Winrevair, a new therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Merck's pipeline features several dozen programs, and it has the means to acquire smaller drugmakers or sign licensing agreements with them, just as it did with LaNova Medicines. Merck is a solid dividend stock, too, with a forward yield of 3.2%. Its payouts have increased by 71% in the past decade. The stock might be 12% since 2024 started because of Keytruda-related issues, but it is still worth buying for long-term investors. Pfizer has yet to win back investors. Once it stopped generating mouthwatering sales from its coronavirus franchise, its shares fell off a cliff and have hardly recovered since. However, Pfizer has made plenty of progress. It has earned several new approvals, including RSV vaccine Abrysvo, alopecia areata treatment Litfulo, and hemophilia therapy Hympavzi. Pfizer also remains a leader in what is left of the COVID-19 vaccine market. In the third quarter, Pfizer's revenue grew by 31% year over year to $17.7 billion. Even excluding the $854 million in sales generated by products from its November 2023 Seagen acquisition, Pfizer's revenue grew by about 25% compared to the year-ago period. Investors might feel as though Pfizer is still too dependent on its COVID-19 products -- they were the biggest reason for its Q3 performance, but they are somewhat seasonal items. That's especially true of Pfizer's vaccine, Comirnaty. So, perhaps the drugmaker can't count on it to drive this kind of top-line growth every quarter. The good news is that Pfizer's innovative wheel keeps rolling. In oncology, the company plans to bring its number of blockbusters to more than eight by 2030 from the five it currently has in this therapeutic area. In weight loss, the hottest field in the industry, Pfizer is developing danuglipron. Pfizer's pipeline features 108 compounds across many studies. Even a handful of approvals or label expansions per year would allow the company to significantly upgrade its lineup and decrease its exposure to the coronavirus market. Lastly, Pfizer is also worth considering for its dividend program. The company's forward yield is a juicy 6.77%, while its payouts increased by 50% in the past 10 years. Pfizer is slowly but surely planning for the future. It might require patience, but the company could deliver rich returns to investors who buy its shares today and hold them for more than five years.

Shares have lost about 1.5% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Verizon due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts. Verizon Beats on Q3 Earnings, Revenues Miss Despite Wireless TractionVerizon recorded relatively healthy third-quarter results with adjusted earnings beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate but the top line missing the same.\\xa0The company recorded consolidated postpaid net additions of 349,000 in the quarter along with retail postpaid phone net additions of 239,000. Total broadband net additions for the quarter were 389,000, including 363,000 fixed wireless net additions. On a GAAP basis, net income in the quarter was $3.41 billion or 78 cents per share compared with $4.88 billion or $1.13 per share in the prior-year quarter. The year-over-year decrease was primarily attributable to a severance charge of $1.7 billion related to the voluntary separation program for select U.S.-based management employees as well as other headcount reduction initiatives. Excluding non-recurring items, quarterly adjusted earnings were $1.19 per share compared with $1.22 in the prior-year quarter. The bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. Quarterly total operating revenues remained flat at $33.33 billion as growth in service revenues and other was offset by lower wireless equipment revenues driven by a challenging macroeconomic environment and lower postpaid phone upgrades. The top line missed the consensus estimate of $33.53 billion. Consumer: Total revenues from this segment improved 0.4% year over year to $25.36 billion, as higher service revenues were partially offset by lower equipment revenues in the quarter. However, it missed our revenue estimate of $25.67 billion for the segment. Service revenues were up 2.2% to $19.26 billion, while wireless equipment revenues declined 8.6% to $4.48 billion. Other revenues totaled $1.62 billion, up 7.8% year over year.The segment recorded 81,000 wireless retail postpaid phone net additions and 80,000 wireless retail prepaid net additions in the quarter. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.07%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 0.84%. The company recorded 39,000 Fios Internet net additions as high demand for reliable fiber optic broadband was spurred by higher video consumption. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 209,000 for the quarter. However, Verizon registered 74,000 Fios Video net losses in the quarter, reflecting the ongoing shift from traditional linear video to over-the-top offerings.The segment’s operating income increased 0.8% to $7.6 billion with a margin of 30%. EBITDA increased 1.8% to $11 billion with a margin of 43.4% compared with 42.8% in the prior-year quarter due to lower costs of wireless equipment.Business: The segment revenues were down 2.3% to $7.35 billion due to lower wireline and wireless equipment revenues, partially offset by growth in wireless service revenue. It also was lower than our estimates of $7.36 billion largely due to challenging macroeconomic conditions.The segment had 281,000 wireless retail postpaid net additions in the quarter, including 158,000 postpaid phone net additions. Wireless retail postpaid churn was 1.45%, while retail postpaid phone churn was 1.1%. Fixed wireless broadband net additions were 154,000 for the quarter. Operating income improved to $565 million from $539 million in the year-ago quarter with respective margins of 7.7% and 7.2%. EBITDA was down 3.7% to $1.61 billion owing to a decline in high-margin wireline revenues for a margin of 21.8% compared with 22.1% in the year-earlier quarter. Total operating expenses increased 6% year over year to $27.4 billion, while operating income declined 20.7% to $5.93 billion. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA increased to $12.49 billion from $12.24 billion led by wireless service revenue growth and perceived benefits from lower upgrade volumes for respective margins of 37.5% and 36.7%. Verizon generated $26.48 billion of net cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2024 compared with $28.8 billion in the year-ago period. The decline was primarily due to higher working capital requirements owing to higher interests and higher taxes. Free cash flow was $5.96 billion for the quarter compared with $6.68 billion in the prior-year period. As of Sept. 30, 2024, the company had $4.99 billion in cash and cash equivalents with $128.88 billion of long-term debt. For 2024, Verizon reiterated its earlier guidance and expects wireless service revenue growth in the range of 2%-3.5%. Adjusted EBITDA is likely to grow 1. The company expects adjusted earnings in the range of $4.50 to $4.70 per share. Capital expenditure is estimated to be within the range of $17 billion and $17.5 billion. In the past month, investors have witnessed a downward trend in estimates revision. Currently, Verizon has an average Growth Score of C, though it is lagging a bit on the Momentum Score front with a D. However, the stock was allocated a grade of A on the value side, putting it in the top quintile for this investment strategy. Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in. Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Verizon has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Texas, Nov. 21, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Verizon, a global leader in driving virtualized and Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) technologies, has deployed Open RAN (O-RAN) based Distributed Antenna Systems (DAS) systems with multiple vendor interoperability at The University of Texas Moody Center and the Austin Convention Center. These are the first DAS systems commercially deployed in the Verizon network using O-RAN interfaces between the various components of the cellular Radio Access Network from different vendors. Both systems use a Samsung vDU with an O-RAN interface to a Commscope DAS, illustrating how ORAN standards can bring together best-in-class products from the ecosystem to create a highly efficient solution and provide Verizon’s high-performing 5G Ultra Wideband service throughout the venues. Not only does this commercial deployment mark a major step towards larger-scale, multi-vendor deployments using O-RAN, but it materially impacts the cost of power, space and cooling by eliminating unnecessary RF equipment, and improves reliability resulting in a gold-standard customer experience for fans and visitors to these venues. “The massive evolution of our network over the past few years including our move to a cloud-based architecture, widespread virtualization and our aggressive adoption of O-RAN standards and capabilities has enabled us to show O-RAN interoperability success in a commercial environment,” said Adam Koeppe, Senior Vice President of Technology Planning at Verizon. O-RAN offers the promise of a wide range of benefits that should introduce new competition and innovation into the RAN ecosystem with the establishment of open and interoperable interfaces between different hardware and software components. The transition to Open RAN has the potential to bring many benefits in terms of deployment flexibility, faster innovation in an open environment, and greater service options by increasing the opportunity for new entrants to provide competitive and advanced solutions.\\xa0More competition, more innovation, and increased supplier diversity will all be net benefits to operators and customers. Verizon has been driving the adoption of O-RAN for years by being a leading voice in developing and adopting O-RAN standards and aggressively deploying more than 130,000 O-RAN capable radios in its network.

High-yielding stocks can be due for cuts to their payouts if a company\\'s underlying financials aren\\'t strong enough to support its dividend payments. But that doesn\\'t mean all high-yielding stocks are dangerous investments. Two good examples of stocks that pay more than 6% and can still be ideal long-term options for retirees are Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ). Although their yields are high, these stocks are not as risky as they may appear to be. Here\\'s why. Are You Missing The Morning Scoop? Breakfast News delivers it all in a quick, Foolish, and free daily newsletter. Sign Up For Free » A bearish outlook for the future has resulted in Pfizer\\'s stock price tumbling more than 10% this year, despite what has generally been a strong year for the markets. The top healthcare stock is trading around its 52-week low, and its yield is incredibly high at around 6.8%. Protecting that dividend is a priority for CEO Albert Bourla, who earlier this year referred to the payout as a \"sacred cow\" for the business, recognizing the importance it has for investors who rely on the recurring payment. Pfizer has been making dividend payments for 344 consecutive quarters, and it has been one of the most stable income stocks to own in the healthcare industry. The company recently raised its guidance for 2024 in light of strong earnings numbers. However, investors remain worried about the future, including how it will deal with a new U.S. administration and the possible implications that changing regulations may have for its operations, and how it will grow as it faces multiple patent cliffs. The reason I\\'m not worried about Pfizer is that regardless of who is in office, there\\'s going to be a need for constant and ongoing innovation in healthcare. Pfizer has been a top name in that regard for decades. Its acquisition of oncology company Seagen last year highlighted its aggressive growth strategy, as the move cost Pfizer $43 billion. It has also pursued smaller companies over the years in a bid to bolster its pipeline and strengthen its growth prospects. As for patent cliffs, they are something that every healthcare company with a top drug will have to worry about at some point. But by focusing on expanding and diversifying its operations, Pfizer is in excellent shape to overcome those challenges. Bourla previously said that by 2030, the company may add up to $25 billion in revenue from new drugs and acquisitions, which will help offset losses due to generics. The company\\'s earnings numbers have been choppy due to write-downs and fluctuating COVID-19-related sales. But last quarter, Pfizer generated $6.1 billion in free cash flow, which is more than twice what it paid in dividends ($2.4 billion). While the company is undoubtedly facing some challenges, the business is in much better shape than bearish investors may give it credit for. Retirees can get another mouthwatering yield from Verizon, which currently pays 6.5%. The telecommunications company has also been increasing its dividend for 18 straight years. The most recent increase came in September when the company boosted its dividend by 1.9%. While that\\'s not a huge increase, it\\'s still a testament to Verizon\\'s commitment to growing the payout. It also comes at a time when the business isn\\'t growing all that fast. This year, the company anticipates a growth rate between 2% and 3.5% in its core wireless service business. But in the long run, there could be more room for Verizon to get bigger. Earlier this year, the company announced plans to acquire Frontier Communications, which will expand its fiber footprint to more markets. The $20 billion deal would be accretive to both Verizon\\'s top and bottom lines as soon as it closes. Frontier shareholders approved the deal, and it\\'s expected to close in early 2026. Verizon is a top name in telecom, but the stock has been an underwhelming buy in recent years as rising interest rates have made investors bearish on capital-intensive businesses. As rates continue to come down and investors seek safety, it may only be a matter of time before shares of Verizon start to rally. While the stock isn\\'t trading at its low for the year, it\\'s still an incredibly cheap buy. Investors can buy it today for less than 9 times next year\\'s estimated profits (based on analyst expectations). Ever feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The MSCI Asia Pacific index climbed as much as 0.7%, as technology stocks in the region rebounded from Thursday’s selloff, encouraged by Nvidia’s gain in the US. Shares in Hong Kong and China fell, extending losses into midday, after an index of US-listed Chinese stocks dropped 1% Thursday. “US exceptionalism remains a fairly strong backdrop in these market conditions,” Taosha Wang, portfolio manager for Fidelity International, said on Bloomberg Television. Artificial intelligence and the potential for pro-growth policies under a Trump administration will support US equities,” she said, while in China following government stimulus, Fidelity is “waiting to see the policy initiatives translate to earnings.” Asian equities are on pace for their first back-to-back monthly losses this year amid strength in the dollar and lingering concerns over the Chinese economy. Still, the region’s more favorable valuations versus the US market are aiding recovery in some assets as US bond yields surge. Bitcoin set a fresh high, climbing briefly past $99,000 on bets President-elect Donald Trump’s support for crypto and a looser regulatory environment will help the industry. A Fox Business News report suggested Chris Giancarlo, a former chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission who’s known as “Crypto Dad” for his early embrace of digital assets, was being weighed as the first “crypto czar” under the incoming administration. Treasury yields slipped on Friday, though, with the 10-year’s easing less than one basis point. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee however, said he sees interest rates moving “a fair bit lower,” expressing confidence inflation is easing toward the central bank’s objective. The greenback was little changed Friday. The dollar index has climbed over 2% this month, adding to the nearly 3% jump last month, amid escalating geopolitical concerns in Europe. The yen fluctuated after edging higher early Friday following inflation data that held above the central bank’s target as expected. “The US dollar made another march to the upside, with some safe-haven flows likely contributed from Ukraine-Russia geopolitical developments,” said Jun Rong Yeap, market strategist at IG Asia. “We may expect tensions to persist as both sides vie to gain some political leverage ahead of any upcoming negotiations under a Trump administration,” he said. Elsewhere in Asia, investors will be monitoring the fallout from a US indictment against Gautam Adani over allegations of bribery. Shares of Adani Group units tumbled and the conglomerate scrapped a $600 million dollar bond sale. The company denied the allegations. DirecTV notified EchoStar Corp. of its intention to terminate an acquisition of Dish Network Corp. after they failed to win the consent of bondholders for a key debt exchange, all but killing a deal to create the largest US pay-TV service. Singapore’s economic expansion fared better than initially expected in the third quarter, prompting the city-state to upgrade its growth forecast for this year as recovery gained momentum. Geopolitical Storm Geopolitical tensions continued to simmer as Russia said it had launched a new kind of ballistic missile into Ukraine, boosting oil and gold prices. West Texas Intermediate gained for a second day. Gold rose for a fifth straight session. “Geopolitics always has a potential of introducing volatility in the market and we have seen that with what is happening in Ukraine,” Themis Themistocleous, chief investment officer, EMEA at UBS Wealth Management told Bloomberg Television. “We have been advising clients to include oil into their portfolio, or derivatives of oil, to be able to hedge against potential volatility.” Key events this week: Eurozone HCOB Manufacturing & Services PMI, Friday US University of Michigan consumer sentiment, Friday Some of the main moves in markets: Stocks S&P 500 futures were little changed as of 2:02 p.m. Tokyo time Japan’s Topix rose 0.6% Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.9% Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.2% The Shanghai Composite fell 1.3% Euro Stoxx 50 futures rose 0.3% Currencies The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.0473 The Japanese yen was little changed at 154.46 per dollar The offshore yuan was little changed at 7.2527 per dollar Cryptocurrencies Bitcoin rose 0.7% to $98,773.17 Ether rose 1.1% to $3,385.51 Bonds The yield on 10-year Treasuries declined one basis point to 4.41% Japan’s 10-year yield declined 1.5 basis points to 1.080% Australia’s 10-year yield declined three basis points to 4.55% Commodities West Texas Intermediate crude rose 0.2% to $70.23 a barrel Spot gold rose 0.6% to $2,686.95 an ounce This story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.

Banks, smaller companies and other areas of the stock market that tend to do best when the economy is strong helped lead the way. In the crypto market, bitcoin eclipsed $99,000 for the first time before pulling back toward $98,000, according to CoinDesk. It’s more than doubled so far this year, and its climb has accelerated since Election Day. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to make the country “the crypto capital  of the planet” and create a “strategic reserve” of bitcoin. As of early Friday, Asia time, bitcoin was trading at $98,925.87. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.1% to 43,870.35, and the Nasdaq composite edged up by less than 0.1% to 18,972.42. Nvidia rose just 0.5% after beating analysts’ estimates  for profit and revenue yet again, but it was still the strongest force pulling the S&P 500 upward. It also gave a forecast for revenue in the current quarter that topped most analysts’ expectations due to voracious demand for its chips used in artificial-intelligence technology. Nearly 90% of the stocks in the S&P 500 advanced on Thursday, and the gains were even bigger among smaller companies. The Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks jumped a market-leading 1.7%. Bitcoin got a boost after Gary Gensler, the chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said Thursday he would step down in January. Gensler has pushed for more protections for crypto investors. Bitcoin and related investment have a notorious history of big price swings in both directions. MicroStrategy, a company that’s been raising cash expressly to buy bitcoin, saw an early Thursday gain of 14.6% for its stock quickly disappear. It finished the day with a loss of 16.2%. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury inched up to 4.43% from 4.41% late Wednesday following some mixed reports on the U.S. economy. One said fewer U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits  last week in the latest signal that the job market remains solid. Another report, though, said manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly shrank. Sales of previously occupied homes, meanwhile, strengthened last month by more  than expected. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude gained 17 cents to $70.27 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 13 cents to $74.36 a barrel.

The broadest benchmark of U.S. shares is now up a bit more than 24% this year, gaining around 3.7% this month after President-elect Donald Trump\\'s early November victory and the second consecutive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve to slow inflation. The benchmark has printed over 50 all-time highs and added nearly $6 trillion in overall market value this year. Now, with Nvidia\\'s\\xa0 (NVDA) \\xa0highly anticipated fiscal third-quarter earnings behind it and the election uncertainty largely erased, stocks could be set for another so-called melt-up that would propel the S&P 500 to top the yearly record 29.6% advance recorded in 2013. Related: Goldman Sachs analyst leads Nvidia price target overhauls after earnings While meager so far, the post-earnings gains in Nvidia stock remain a huge component of the market\\'s broader health, given its outsized weighting in the S&P 500 and the tech-focused Nasdaq and its newly minted position in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. \"Nvidia moves the largest amount of money for a single stock in the world each day, dwarfing every other name in both U.S. and international markets,\" said Kristian Kerr, head of macro strategy at LPL Financial.\\xa0\"Furthermore, the company’s earnings report has essentially reached the same level of importance as a major macroeconomic data release. 🐂 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 🐻 \"While Nvidia has consistently topped earnings estimates, and the long-term trend for the chipmaking behemoth has been up and to the right, subsequent one-day price action has been mixed while investors parse results, and semiconductor names face increasing scrutiny in today’s market,\" she added. \"The post-earnings one-week absolute move for Nvidia over the past 10 years has been slightly below 11%.\" Risk appetite, evident in the spate of all-time highs seen in bitcoin prices and the huge amounts of cash moving into U.S. equity funds, suggests the S&P 500 could find the 4.5-percentage-point gain it needs by year\\'s end to reach the 6,185-point level required to deliver a record annual return. Bank of America\\'s closely tracked Flow Show report, published last week, said global investors are \"all-in on Trump 2.0\" and are positioned for further gains in U.S. assets into the January 20 inauguration. U.S. stock funds, the report indicated, gathered $55.8 billion in new money last week, the most since March. There were record flows into large-capitalization names and the best new allocation for small-cap funds this year. Readings from the broader economy also suggest the chances for year-end outperformance are solid. Walmart\\xa0 (WMT) \\xa0forecast a solid holiday-spending season, and the Atlanta Fed\\'s GDPNow\\xa0forecasting tool pegs current-quarter growth at a solid 2.6%, a pace major economies worldwide can only aspire to at this stage of the post-pandemic recovery. \"Looking ahead, solid income growth, pro-cyclical productivity growth and strong labor force participation should remain the key pillars of US exceptionalism,\" EY\\'s chief economist, Gregory Daco, said. He cited \"stronger private sector confidence on the prospects of pro-business policies and deregulation\" supporting spending and investment. Related: Top Wall Street analyst unveils unexpected S&P 500 price target for 2025 Corporate earnings also underpinned the market\\'s late-autumn gains, with collective third-quarter S&P 500 profits estimated to have risen 8.8% from a year earlier to $527.4 billion. That pace is likely to reach 9.8% over the fourth quarter, LSEG data show. \"I thought earnings season was pretty darn good,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer at Laffer Tengler Investments. \"Earnings are outpacing the macroeconomy as companies expand margins faster than revenue growth,\" she added. \"We have long argued that productivity would save the day, and it seems to be showing up to do the heavy lifting.\" Jan Boivin, head of BlackRock\\'s Investment Institute, argues that\\xa0a\\xa0\"more favorable macro backdrop and upbeat investor sentiment given post-election clarity and hopes for deregulation\" have the firm \"more pro-risk on a six- to 12-month tactical horizon\" despite longer-term uncertainties. An end-of-year rally will also face headwinds, with U.S. stocks priced at their highest multiple of forward earnings in at least five years. The prospect of renewed inflation risks are also leaning against the prospect of a December interest rate cut from the\\xa0Federal Reserve.

Geopolitical risks are also simmering, with Russia\\'s attacks on Ukraine threatening to devolve into a wider and more deadly conflict, and the ongoing tensions between Israel and its Arab Gulf neighbors risk drawing Iran into a broader regional war. The earnings picture is also narrowing, with negative preannouncements heading into the fourth quarter rising at a 2.2 ratio to positive ones, according to LSEG data. That suggests the corporate sector\\xa0is more cautious. Also weighing on the major stock market indexes is the potential impact of Trump\\'s policy suite. Significant tax cuts, historic tariffs on imported goods, and the threat of mass deportation of immigrants could hollow out key sectors of the labor market and stoke inflation.

The AI chip darling once again warned investors in its quarterly 10-Q filing to the SEC that it has key accounts so crucial that their orders each crossed the threshold of ten percent of Nvidia’s global consolidated turnover. An elite trio of particularly deep-pocketed customers for example individually purchased between $10-$11 billion worth of goods and services across the first nine months that ended in late October. Fortunately for Nvidia investors, this won’t change any time soon. Mandeep Singh, global head of technology research at Bloomberg Intelligence, says he believes founder and CEO Jensen Huang’s prediction that spending will not stop. “The data center training market could hit $1 trillion without any real pullback,” by that point Nvidia share will almost certainly drop markedly from their current 90%. But it could still be in the hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue annually. Outside of defense contractors living off of the Pentagon, it’s highly unusual that a company has such a concentration of risk among a handful of customers—let alone one poised to become the first worth the astronomical sum of $4 trillion. Strictly looking at Nvidia’s accounts on a three-month basis, there were four anonymous whales that, in total, comprised nearly every second dollar of sales in the second fiscal quarter, this time at least one of them has dropped out since now only three still meet that criteria. Singh told Fortune the anonymous whales likely include Microsoft, Meta, and possibly Super Micro. But Nvidia declined to comment on the speculation. Nvidia only refers to them as Customers A, B, and C, and all told they purchased a collective $12.6 billion in goods and services. This was more than a third of Nvidia’s overall $35.1 billion recorded for the fiscal third quarter through late October. Their share was also divided up equally with each accounting for 12%, suggesting they were likely receiving a maximum amount of chips allocated to them rather than as many as they might have ideally wanted. This would fit with comments from founder and CEO Jensen Huang that his company is supply constrained. Nvidia cannot simply pump out more chips, since it has outsourced wholesale fabrication of its industry-leading AI microchips to Taiwan’s TSMC and has no production facilities of its own. Importantly, Nvidia\\'s designation of major anonymous customers as \"Customer A\", \"Customer B,\" and so on is not fixed from one fiscal period to the next. They can and do change places, with Nvidia keeping their identity a trade secret for competitive reasons—no doubt these customers would not like their investors, employees, critics, activists and rivals being able to see exactly how much money they spend on Nvidia chips. For example, one party designated “Customer A” bought around $4.2 billion in goods and services over the past quarterly fiscal period. Yet it appears to have accounted for less in the past, since it does not exceed the 10% mark across the first nine months in total. Meanwhile “Customer D” appears to have done the exact opposite, reducing purchases of Nvidia chips in the past fiscal quarter yet nevertheless representing 12% of turnover year-to-date. Since their names are secret it’s difficult to say whether they are middle men like the troubled Super Micro Computer, which supplies data center hardware, or end users like Elon Musk’s xAI. The latter came out of nowhere for example to build up its new Memphis compute cluster in just three months time. Ultimately, however, there are only a handful of companies with the capital to be able to compete in the AI race as training large language models can be exorbitantly costly. Typically these are the cloud computing hyperscalers such as Microsoft. Oracle for example recently announced plans to build a\\xa0zettascale data center\\xa0with over 131,000 Nvidia state-of-the-art Blackwell AI training chip, which would be more powerful than any individual site yet existing. It’s estimated the electricity needed to run such a massive compute cluster would be equivalent to the output capacity of nearly\\xa0two dozen nuclear power plants. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Singh really only sees a few longer term risks for Nvidia. For one, some hyperscalers will likely reduce orders eventually, diluting its market share. One such likely candidate is Alphabet, which has its own training chips called TPUs. Secondly, its dominance in training is not matched by inference, which run generative AI models after they have already been trained. Here the technical requirements are not nearly as state of the art, meaning there is much more competition not just from rivals like AMD but also companies with their own custom silicon like Tesla. Eventually inference will be a much more meaningful business as more and more businesses utilize AI. “There are a lot of companies trying to focus on that inferencing opportunity, because you don’t need the highest-end GPU accelerator chip for that,” Singh said. Asked if this longer term shift to inferencing was the bigger risk than eventually losing share of the market in training chips, he replied: “Absolutely”.

Here is a summary of his thoughts: NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s earnings report provides insight into the company’s growth trajectory, highlighting the aspects that matter and those that don’t. The company delivered $35 billion in revenue for the October quarter, meeting whisper numbers, and issued a January guidance of $37.5 billion, slightly below the whisper number of $38 billion. Gross margins dipped a bit too, but ultimately these numbers don't matter as much. The AI star lies in a boom or bust industry. Before the generative AI excitement, the company’s business declined 21% year-over-year. However, Nvidia’s market cap has skyrocketed since, driven by the extraordinary demand for its Blackwell GPUs. The true pressure point for Nvidia lies in the commentary about Blackwell, Nvidia’s generative AI architecture. Looking at the key commentary from Nvidia’s CFO, we find that demand for Blackwell will continue to exceed supply for several quarters. There have also been some supply difficulties, albeit quite small.\\xa0 This narrative has evolved positively compared to the October earnings call, with supply constraints expected to ease slightly earlier—from “into 2025” to “mid-2025.” Additionally, the earnings call mentions twice that the demand for Blackwell has grown even stronger over the past three months, setting up 2025 as a robust year. While this doesn’t provide complete visibility into 2026, it does base a strong foundation for continued momentum. Driving Nvidia’s growth is the principle of scaling laws. Scaling is what's effectively needed to make AI models smarter. Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s CEO, likened this to Moore’s Law, where CPU speeds doubled every few years even though it was expected otherwise. The industry’s continuous innovation and adherence to scaling principles are bound to propel Nvidia’s AI computing demand, reinforcing the long-term outlook. Wall Street projects 20% year-over-year growth for calendar year 2026. Based on Nvidia’s trajectory, Deepwater anticipates this could accelerate to over 30% growth, stating that there is plenty of time for the business to appreciate. Our research director shared his views on NVDA's earnings results here. He thinks NVDA stock can reach $170 within 3 months. While we acknowledge the potential of NVDA as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

CARVYKTI® previously received a Notice of Compliance with conditions (NOC/c) from Health Canada for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody, and who are refractory to their last treatment.1 Canada\\'s Drug Agency (CDA-AMC) has recently recommended CARVYKTI® for reimbursement with conditions for eligible patients who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. In its rationale for the recommendation, CDA-AMC pointed out that the CARTITUDE-4 trial demonstrated that treatment with CARVYKTI®, compared to standard of care, was associated with statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS) in eligible patients. This builds on their prior recommendation for reimbursement with conditions for CARVYKTI® in 2023 in eligible patients who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, based on the results of the CARTITUDE-1 trial. Johnson & Johnson is actively working with the pan-Canadian Pharmaceutical Alliance to negotiate reimbursement for CARVYKTI® to enable public access. \"The new approval for CARVYKTI® fills an important gap for patients with multiple myeloma who may require this therapy as early as first relapse and represents a significant milestone for Canadian patients with this disease,\" says Dr. Donna Reece*, MD, Chief Medical Officer, Canadian Myeloma Research Group. \"The first approval for CARVYKTI® was for its use in treating patients with refractory myeloma who had received at least three prior lines of therapy that included the three main drug classes (proteasome inhibitors, immunomodulatory drugs and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies). However, myeloma treatment options have advanced rapidly, and Canadian patients with relapsed multiple myeloma may have received all these agents in second- or even first-line treatment, and yet have not qualified for CARVYKTI® — a highly effective immunotherapy that is transforming the treatment of multiple myeloma. This expanded indication will allow eligible patients with multiple myeloma to receive CARVYKTI® much earlier in their treatment journey.\" \"The clinical trial showed that a single infusion of CARVYKTI® significantly lowered the risk of disease progression or death compared to current standard of care,\" says Dr. Richard LeBlanc**, Hematologist, Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital. \"This authorization means patients have a more effective treatment option that offers an opportunity for a deeper and durable response as early as their first relapse.\" Multiple myeloma is the second most common form of blood cancer in Canada and it is estimated that 1,750 Canadians will die from the disease in 2024.2,3 While the introduction of novel therapies in recent years has led to significant improvements in PFS and overall survival (OS) in patients with multiple myeloma, the disease remains incurable, with nearly all patients relapsing and requiring subsequent therapy.4,5 As the disease progresses, patients experience cycles of relapse and remission, with periods of remission generally becoming progressively shorter with each new line of therapy.6,7 \"With the progressive, cyclical nature of multiple myeloma, the sooner we can give patients the treatment that is right for them, the higher the likelihood that more patients achieve better outcomes and an improved quality of life,\" says Martine Elias***, CEO, Myeloma Canada. \"This approval offers patients hope that their next treatment will help extend remission and give them more precious quality time with their loved ones.\" This\\xa0latest Health Canada authorization\\xa0is based on results from the Phase 3\\xa0CARTITUDE-4 study, a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI® versus standard of care regimens of either pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd) in patients with relapsed and lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who received one to three prior lines of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent.1 A total of 419 patients were randomized to receive CARVYKTI®\\xa0(208 patients) or standard of care (211 patients).1\\xa0Of the patients in the standard of care arm, 183 received DPd and 28 received PVd.1 All the patients in the CARVYKTI®\\xa0arm underwent leukapheresis and received bridging therapy.1 At a median follow-up of 15.9 months, a 74 per cent reduction in the risk of disease progression or death (PFS Hazard Ratio [HR]=0.26; 95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.18–0.38; p value p<0.0001) was observed in patients randomized to the CARVYKTI® arm compared to standard of care treatments.1 The most common nonlaboratory adverse reactions (incidence greater than 20 per cent) in CARTITUDE-4 were pyrexia, cytokine release syndrome, hypogammaglobulinemia, musculoskeletal pain, diarrhea, fatigue, upper respiratory tract infection, headache, hypotension, viral infection and nausea.1 The long-term results from the Phase 3 CARTITUDE-4 study shared by Johnson & Johnson at the 2024 International Myeloma Society (IMS) Annual Meeting (Abstract #OA-65) showed a single infusion of CARVYKTI®\\xa0significantly extended OS in patients with relapsed or lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory drug, reducing the risk of death by 45 per cent versus standard therapies of PVd or DPd. With these data, CARVYKTI® is now the first and only cell therapy to improve OS versus standard therapies for patients with lenalidomide-refractory multiple myeloma as early as second line.8 \"This milestone underscores our commitment to discovering and developing best-in-class therapies, particularly for incurable forms of cancer where patients face difficult prognoses,\" says Berkeley Vincent, President, Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine, Canada. \"CARVYKTI® plays an important role in our work to redefine multiple myeloma and ultimately help patients achieve sustained remission. We are determined to get in front of cancer and these recent regulatory and access milestones for CARVYKTI® represent critical steps forward in reaching this goal.\" About CARVYKTI® CARVYKTI® (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) received a NOC/c from Health Canada in February 2023 for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody, and who are refractory to their last treatment.1 An NOC/c is a form of market approval granted to a product on the basis of promising evidence of clinical effectiveness following review of the submission by Health Canada. CARVYKTI®\\xa0was authorized by Health Canada in July 2024 for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, and who are refractory to lenalidomide.1 CARVYKTI® is a BCMA-directed, genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy, which involves reprogramming a patient\\'s own T-cells with a transgene encoding a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that identifies and eliminates cells that express BCMA.1 BCMA is primarily expressed on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B-lineage cells, as well as late-stage B cells and plasma cells.1 The\\xa0CARVYKTI® CAR protein features two BCMA-targeting single-domain antibodies designed to confer high avidity against human BCMA.1 Upon binding to BCMA-expressing cells, the CAR promotes T-cell, activation, expansion and elimination of target cells.1 About the CARTITUDE-4 Study CARTITUDE-4 (MMY3002, NCT04181827) is an international, randomized, open-label Phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of CARVYKTI®\\xa0versus pomalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (PVd) or daratumumab, pomalidomide and dexamethasone (DPd).1,9 About Johnson & Johnson At Johnson & Johnson,\\xa0we believe health is everything.

About multiple myeloma Multiple\\xa0myeloma is an incurable blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called plasma cells, which are found in the bone marrow.1 In multiple myeloma, these plasma cells proliferate and spread rapidly and replace normal cells in the bone marrow with tumors.2 Multiple myeloma is the third most common blood cancer worldwide and remains an incurable disease.3 In 2024, it was estimated that more than 35,000 people will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the U.S. and more than 12,000 people would die from the disease.4 People living with multiple myeloma have a 5-year survival rate of 59.8 percent.5 While some people diagnosed with multiple myeloma initially have no symptoms, most patients are diagnosed due to symptoms that can include bone fracture or pain, low red blood cell counts, tiredness, high calcium levels and kidney problems or infections.6,7 About smoldering multiple myeloma Smoldering multiple\\xa0myeloma is an asymptomatic precursor state to multiple myeloma (MM). Patients with SMM have higher levels of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and an elevated monoclonal protein (M-protein) level in the blood, but they do not yet exhibit the symptoms commonly associated with active multiple myeloma, particularly end-organ damage. Fifteen percent of all cases of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma are classified as smoldering multiple myeloma, and half of those diagnosed with high-risk disease will progress to active multiple myeloma within two years.8 About warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia Warm\\xa0autoimmune hemolytic anemia (wAIHA) is a rare, life-threatening condition where autoantibodies lead to the premature destruction of red blood cells (RBCs), resulting in anemia, which can cause symptoms like debilitating fatigue, dizziness, shortness of breath, jaundice and in severe cases, chest pain or loss of consciousness.9 Approximately 1-3 new people per 100,000 are affected by wAIHA per year, and about 1 in 8,000 individuals are living with the condition.9,10\\xa0This condition affects both women and men and can affect people at any age with incidence increasing over the age of 50.10,11 There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs indicated for wAIHA, and treatment typically consists of corticosteroids, broad immunosuppressants and B-cell directed therapies.9\\xa0With an unmet need for treatment in wAIHA, continued research for evidence-based potential therapies is critical.12 About fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (FNAIT) is a rare and potentially life-threatening alloimmune condition in which a pregnant person\\'s immune system develops alloantibodies against fetal or newborn platelet antigens, leading to thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts) in the fetus or newborn.13 FNAIT can result in severe bleeding complications for a fetus or newborn and is characterized by organ bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, or eyes.13 If a severe bleed occurs in the brain, termed intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), death or life-long neurologic effects may occur.13\\xa0ICH occurs in up to 26 percent of untreated pregnancies with FNAIT.14 It has an estimated incidence rate of 1 in 1000 pregnancies.13,15\\xa0 There are no approved therapies for the treatment of FNAIT. Because FNAIT is not routinely screened for during pregnancy, the diagnosis of an affected FNAIT pregnancy often occurs postnatally.13 About DARZALEX®\\xa0and DARZALEX\\xa0FASPRO® DARZALEX\\xa0FASPRO®\\xa0(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj)\\xa0received\\xa0U.S. FDA approval in May 2020 and is approved for nine indications in multiple myeloma, four of which are for frontline treatment in newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible or ineligible.16 It is the only subcutaneous CD38-directed antibody approved to treat patients with MM. DARZALEX\\xa0FASPRO®\\xa0is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20, Halozyme\\'s ENHANZE®\\xa0drug delivery technology. DARZALEX®\\xa0(daratumumab) received\\xa0U.S. FDA approval in November 2015 and is approved in eight indications, three of which are in the frontline setting, including newly diagnosed patients who are transplant eligible and ineligible.17 DARZALEX®\\xa0is the first CD38-directed antibody approved to treat multiple myeloma.17\\xa0DARZALEX®-based regimens have been used in the treatment of more than 585,000 patients worldwide and more than 239,000 patients in the U.S. alone. In\\xa0August 2012, Janssen Biotech, Inc. and Genmab A/S entered a worldwide agreement, which granted Janssen an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize daratumumab. Since 2020, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network®\\xa0(NCCN®) has recommended daratumumab-based combination regimens for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.†\\xa0For newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in non-transplant candidates, the NCCN®\\xa0guidelines recommend daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone as a Category 1 preferred regimen; daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, melphalan, and prednisone as another recommended Category 1 regimen; and daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, cyclophosphamide, and prednisone as another recommended Category 2A regimen. For newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in transplant candidates, the NCCN®\\xa0guidelines recommend daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone as another recommended Category 2A regimen; daratumumab in combination with bortezomib, thalidomide and dexamethasone as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances; daratumumab in combination with carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances; and daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances. For maintenance in transplant candidates, the NCCN® guidelines recommend daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide as useful in certain circumstances. In relapsed/refractory myeloma, four daratumumab regimens are listed as Category 1 preferred regimens for early relapses (1-3 prior therapies): daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone; daratumumab in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone; daratumumab in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone; and daratumumab in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone [after one prior therapy including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor]. The NCCN®\\xa0also recommends daratumumab in combination with cyclophosphamide, bortezomib and dexamethasone as another Category 2A regimen for early relapses (1-3 prior therapies) and as monotherapy as a Category 2A regimen useful in certain circumstances for early relapse patients after at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor and an immunomodulatory agent, or for patients who are double refractory to a PI and an immunomodulatory agent.

About CARVYKTI® CARVYKTI® is a BCMA-directed, genetically modified autologous T-cell immunotherapy that involves reprogramming a patient\\'s own T-cells with a transgene encoding chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that directs the CAR-positive T cells to eliminate cells that express BCMA. BCMA is primarily expressed on the surface of malignant multiple myeloma B-lineage cells, as well as late-stage B cells and plasma cells. The CARVYKTI® CAR protein features two BCMA-targeting single domains designed to confer high avidity against human BCMA. Upon binding to BCMA-expressing cells, the CAR promotes T-cell activation, expansion, and elimination of target cells. CARVYKTI® (cilta-cel) received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval\\xa0in February 2022 for the treatment of adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma after four or more prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. In April 2024, CARVYKTI® was approved\\xa0in the U.S. for\\xa0 treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior line of therapy including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and who are refractory to lenalidomide, following a unanimous (11 to 0) FDA Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) recommendation in support of this new indication. In April 2024, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved\\xa0a Type II variation for CARVYKTI® for the treatment of adults with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy, including an immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor, have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy, and are refractory to lenalidomide. In December 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc., a Johnson & Johnson company, entered into an exclusive worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Legend Biotech USA, Inc. to develop and commercialize CARVYKTI®. For more information, visit www.CARVYKTI.com. About TECVAYLI® TECVAYLI® (teclistamab-cqyv) received approval from the U.S. FDA in October 2022 as an off-the-shelf (or ready-to-use) antibody that is administered as a subcutaneous treatment for adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody.18 The EC granted TECVAYLI® conditional marketing authorization (CMA) in August 2022 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with RRMM who have received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 antibody, and have demonstrated disease progression since the last therapy. In August 2023, the EC granted the approval of a Type II variation application for TECVAYLI®, providing the option for a reduced dosing frequency of 1.5 mg/kg every two weeks in patients who have achieved a complete response or better for a minimum of six months. TECVAYLI® is a first-in-class, bispecific T-cell engager antibody therapy that uses innovative science to activate the immune system by binding to the CD3 receptor expressed on the surface of T-cells and to the B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and some healthy B-lineage cells. In February 2024, the U.S. FDA approved the supplemental Biologics License Application for TECVAYLI® for a reduced dosing frequency of 1.5 mg/kg every two weeks in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have achieved and maintained a CR or better for a minimum of six months. For more information, visit www.TECVAYLI.com. About TALVEY® TALVEY® (talquetamab-tgvs) received\\xa0approval from the U.S. FDA in August 2023 as a first-in-class GPRC5D-targeting bispecific antibody for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior lines of therapy, including a proteasome inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 antibody.19\\xa0Since FDA approval, 1,800 patients were treated with TALVEY®. The European Commission (EC) granted\\xa0conditional marketing authorization\\xa0(CMA) of TALVEY®\\xa0(talquetamab-tgvs) in August 2023 as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy.20 TALVEY®\\xa0is a bispecific T-cell engaging antibody that binds to the CD3 receptor expressed on the surface of T-cells and G protein-coupled receptor class C group 5 member D (GPRC5D), a novel multiple myeloma target which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and non-malignant plasma cells, as well as some healthy tissues such as epithelial cells of the skin and tongue. About IMBRUVICA® IMBRUVICA® (ibrutinib) is a once-daily oral medication that is jointly developed and commercialized by Janssen Biotech, Inc., and Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. IMBRUVICA® blocks the BTK protein, which is needed by normal and abnormal B cells, including specific cancer cells, to multiply and spread. By blocking BTK, IMBRUVICA® may help move abnormal B cells out of their nourishing environments and inhibit their proliferation.21,22, 23 IMBRUVICA® is approved in more than 100 countries and has been used to treat more than 300,000 patients worldwide over the last decade. There are more than 50 company-sponsored clinical trials, including 18 Phase 3 studies, spanning more than 11 years evaluating the efficacy and safety of IMBRUVICA®. IMBRUVICA® was first approved by the U.S. FDA in November 2013, and today is indicated for adult patients in four disease areas. These include indications to treat adults with chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma with or without 17p deletion; adults with Waldenström\\'s macroglobulinemia; and adult and pediatric patients aged one year and older with previously treated chronic graft versus host disease after failure of one or more lines of systemic therapy.24 About Nipocalimab Nipocalimab is an investigational monoclonal antibody, designed to bind with high affinity to block FcRn and reduce levels of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies potentially without impact on other immune functions. This includes autoantibodies and alloantibodies that underlie multiple conditions across three key segments in the autoantibody space including Rare Autoantibody diseases, Maternal Fetal diseases mediated by maternal alloantibodies and Prevalent Rheumatology.25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33\\xa0Blockade of IgG binding to FcRn in the placenta is also believed to limit transplacental transfer of maternal alloantibodies to the fetus.34,35 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) have granted several key designations to nipocalimab including: U.S. FDA Fast Track designation in hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn (HDFN) and wAIHA in July 2019, gMG in December 2021 and FNAIT in March 2024 U.S. FDA Orphan drug status for wAIHA in December 2019, HDFN in June 2020, gMG in February 2021, chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) in October 2021 and FNAIT in December 2023 U.S. FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation for HDFN in February 2024 and for Sjögren\\'s disease (SjD) in November 2024 EU EMA Orphan medicinal product designation for HDFN in October 2019 About Johnson & Johnson At Johnson & Johnson, we believe health is everything.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term. Shares of this world's biggest maker of health care products have returned -5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +0.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson & Johnson belongs, has lost 14.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Johnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $1.99 per share, indicating a change of -13.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.7% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.93 points to a change of +0.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.54 indicates a change of +6.1% from what Johnson & Johnson is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Johnson & Johnson. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Johnson & Johnson, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $22.54 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $88.84 billion and $91.25 billion estimates indicate -4.5% and +2.7% changes, respectively. Johnson & Johnson reported revenues of $22.47 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.3%. EPS of $2.42 for the same period compares with $2.66 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.19 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.27%. The EPS surprise was +9.01%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period. Without considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Johnson & Johnson is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Johnson & Johnson. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily BioPharma Dive newsletter. An experimental pill developed by Johnson & Johnson and Protagonist Therapeutics significantly cleared skin in most people with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who enrolled in a Phase 3 trial run by J&J. Treatment with the drug, called icotrokinra, led to clear or almost clear skin in about two-thirds of participants after four months of testing. Just under half experienced a 90% or greater reduction in their scores on another measure of psoriasis plaque coverage and severity. Only 8% and 4%, respectively, of study participants on placebo hit those same marks. Responses to icotrokinra improved further through six months and, according to a Monday statement from J&J, a similar percentage of participants in both trial groups experienced side effects. The company plans to present detailed results at an upcoming medical meeting. Icotrokinra is the product of a research collaboration\\xa0J&J and Protagonist struck just over seven years ago. It’s meant to match, or at least come close to, the effectiveness of injectable drugs now commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions like psoriasis, but with the convenience of being taken orally. Drugmakers the industry over have embarked on a similar mission, investing in medicines aimed at an array of enzymes and proteins that help control the body’s immune response. Icotrokinra takes aim at receptor known as IL-23, blocking the same signaling pathway as AbbVie’s fast-selling injection Skyrizi and J&J’s own Tremfya. The good news from Monday’s results, according to Leerink Partners’ David Risinger, is that icotrokinra’s efficacy seems “roughly comparable” to the older injectable drug Stelara and potentially “superior” to oral drugs like Sotyktu\\xa0and Otezla that are approved for psoriasis. However, the analyst wrote in a client note Tuesday, icotrokinra seems less effective than Skyrizi and Tremfya, which may limit its ability to directly replace those treatments. The main measures of success in J&J’s study, called ICONIC-LEAD, were improvements on the Investigator's Global Assessment, or IGA, and the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index, or PASI. Scores of 0 or 1 on IGA correspond to clear or nearly clear skin and, by week 24, 74% of icotrokinra-treated participants met that criteria. PASI, by comparison, measures the total area of skin affected by psoriasis plaques, as well as how red and thick those plaques are. So-called PASI 90 refers to a 90% or greater improvement in PASI scores compared to baseline measurements. About half of the people on icotrokinra hit this threshold by week 16, and 65% did by week 24. Adjusted for placebo response rates through week 16, icotrokinra’s 45% rate on PASI 90 is well below the roughly 70% rate seen in trials of Skyrizi and Tremfya, according to Risinger. Still, Risinger expects J&J can eventually meet its forecast of greater than $5 billion in peak annual sales of icotrokinra, as he sees it helping expand the market share of IL-23 drugs. In addition to announcing data from ICONIC-LEAD, J&J also said that another Phase 3 study, ICONIC-TOTAL, succeeded, showing once-daily icotrokinra met its main goal on IGA compared to placebo by week 16. Results from both studies will be included in approval applications J&J is now preparing. The company is also testing its drug against Sotyktu, which is sold by Bristol Myers Squibb, in two Phase 3 trials of people with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Studies evaluating icotrokina in psoriatic arthritis are set to begin next year, while results from a Phase 2 test in ulcerative colitis are anticipated before June. As a result of icotrokinra’s success in Phase 3, Protagonist has earned $165 million in milestone payments from J&J, which the biotechnology company said it expects to receive from J&J in the first quarter.\"}\n",

Around 64.7% of subjects who were given icotrokinra in the study achieved clear or almost clear skin (IGA scores of 0/1) after 16 weeks. In addition, 49.6% of patients had achieved a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 90 response by week 16, significantly outperforming the placebo group. By week 24, the response rates improved further, with 74.1% achieving IGA 0/1 scores and 64.9% reaching PASI 90. The trial met its co-primary endpoints at week 16, with significant skin clearance observed in the icotrokinra group compared to subjects given placebo. Its safety data was in line with findings from earlier studies, while the proportion of patients who had experienced treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between the icotrokinra and placebo arms, at 49.3% and 49.1% respectively, at week 16. The Phase III ICONIC-TOTAL trial also reported positive topline outcomes, with icotrokinra meeting the primary endpoint of IGA 0/1 at week 16 against placebo. Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine Immunodermatology Disease area lead and vice-president Liza O’Dowd said: “We are excited to see impressive Phase III results with once-daily icotrokinra treatment aligned with our Phase II study of this first-in-class targeted oral peptide that selectively blocks the IL-23 receptor. “The majority of people living with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis are eligible for, but are still not receiving, advanced therapies. “Icotrokinra has the potential to offer once-daily oral therapy that could help address the needs and preferences of people living with plaque psoriasis.” Plaque psoriasis is a chronic immune-mediated disease characterised by the overproduction of skin cells. It leads to itchy or painful inflamed and scaly plaques.

Dish hasn’t initiated fresh discussions with bondholders to try and salvage the deal as of late Thursday evening, a person familiar with the matter said. Under the terms of the original transaction, DirecTV was to acquire Dish and Sling TV from EchoStar Corp. for $1 plus the assumption of about $9.75 billion of debt. DirecTV, which is owned by AT&T Inc. and joint venture partner TPG Inc., would have become the largest pay-TV provider in the US with about 18 million subscribers. “While we believed a combination of DirecTV and Dish would have benefitted all stakeholders, we have terminated the transaction because the proposed Exchange Terms were necessary to protect DirecTV’s balance sheet and our operational flexibility,” DirecTV Chief Executive Officer Bill Morrow said in a statement. A group of Dish bondholders rejected an improved offer put forward by DirecTV at the end of October. The revised terms lowered the minimum loss on $8.9 billion of bonds by $70 million to $1.5 billion. The action doesn’t impact TPG’s planned acquisition of AT&T’s stake in DirecTV.

The unusual challenge set off speculation that the lawsuit was driven at least in part by a desire to punish CNN for critical coverage of Trump. Although the lawsuit eventually failed and the deal went through, the damage was done. The Trump administration’s legal challenge cost AT&T precious time in the rapidly evolving media landscape and helped doom the merger. Now, Trump is returning to power at a time when the hobbled media industry appears to be on the cusp of another frenzy of deals. And his administration will have ample opportunities to slow or even kill future transactions – lifeboats that some media companies may need to survive. Case in point: Comcast revealed on Wednesday plans to spin off MSNBC, CNBC and other cable assets into a company that’s separate from the NBC broadcast network. The spinoff itself won’t require approval from the DOJ or the Federal Communications Commission. But it’s widely expected the spinoff company will need to find a dance partner to make it through the world of cord-cutting. That will give Trump-appointed regulators an opportunity to damage a network he’s clashed with for many years. “There are only two media entities that Donald Trump dislikes more than CNN. One is MSNBC and the other is NBC,” Craig Moffett, a media veteran and founder of MoffettNathanson, said in a phone interview. Eyebrows in the media industry raised this week when Brendan Carr, Trump’s nominee to lead the FCC, linked the agency’s review of the Skydance-Paramount deal to a “60 Minutes” interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. Carr told Fox News that the FCC will want to review transcripts from the “60 Minutes” interview as part of its review of Skydance’s proposed deal with CBS owner Paramount. “That speaks volumes. It says that media outlets traditionally described as liberal may have a very hard time doing deals,” said Moffett. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, founder and president of the Yale Chief Executive Leadership Institute, told CNN that the opportunity for a “brilliant re-clustering” of media businesses is being clouded by the incoming Trump administration. Sonnenfeld, a contributor to CNBC, suggested that Trump’s “overt vindictiveness” could lead officials to slow-walk deals to hurt their value for “revenge,” even if those deals ultimately prevail in court. Sonnenfeld argued that’s exactly what happened with the AT&T-Time Warner deal. “They slow-walked it. AT&T ultimately won, but it was a pyrrhic victory. They lost a window. It became a bad deal,” he said. Trump’s victory initially set off a party among Wall Street dealmakers, with many cheering the end of the Biden administration’s intense antitrust scrutiny. It’s true that analysts expect the Trump administration to generally be less hostile to mergers. Trump will likely replace the Biden administration’s tough antitrust cop, Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan. Yet it’s also true that some Republicans – including some tapped to join the Trump administration – have been described as “Khanservatives” because they’ve called for tougher, not weaker, antitrust scrutiny. In February, Vice President-elect JD Vance said Khan is “one of the few people in the Biden administration that I think is doing a pretty good job.” Trump planned to lead the DOJ with another Khan fan: former Florida congressman Matt Gaetz. Earlier this year, Gaetz told NOTUS that the FCC chair’s work “inspired me” and he expressed hope she stays in power for a Trump administration. Gaetz announced Thursday afternoon that he is withdrawing from consideration as Trump’s pick for attorney general, a decision that came as he faced growing scrutiny over sexual misconduct allegations. As Gaetz fought earlier this week to survive a tough nomination process, Comcast dropped a bombshell in the media industry by spinning off MSNBC, CNBC, USA, Oxygen and other networks. Brian Roberts, the CEO of Comcast, said Wednesday that the new company will be “highly attractive to investors, content creators, distributors and potential partners.” Comcast promises the new entity, for now known as SpinCo, will start with a growth trajectory and significant financial firepower. But there is already speculation it may need to bulk up to survive. That could mean a sale to another entity or an acquisition. Either way, a future deal would likely require approval from the DOJ and other Trump regulators. (The FCC’s blessing may not be required because SpinCo won’t include the NBC broadcast network). Jettisoned from the Comcast mothership and its stable cash flows, the spinoff cable channels will have less financial protection from the volatility of the TV industry, not to mention less of a shield from the Trump administration. “This will be an interesting experiment,” said Frank Louthan, an analyst at Raymond James. “In theory, they should be able to survive if appropriately capitalized. But it’s unclear. It’s definitely going to be a challenge for them.” One major obstacle for Comcast’s spinoff cable assets is they will need to reach new agreements to distribute content without being part of the larger NBC bundle – at a time of aggressive cord-cutting. “If this was an easy thing to do, we would have already seen it happen,” said Louthan. “My guess is over the medium term, they will either do an acquisition or be acquired.” However, Louthan argued that a deal would not be imminent because the spinoff will take a year to complete, suggesting a transaction may not occur until after the end of Trump’s term. Lee Petro, a member of the law firm Dickinson Wright’s Washington DC office, said it’s “definitely possible” the DOJ reviews a future deal involving the spinoff cable channels “to cause pain” to those networks. “It’s hard not to look at the spinoff of CNBC and MSNBC as potentially a response to the new administration,” said Petro. A source familiar with the matter says the company had been evaluating the potential transaction for some time, well before the administration change. The Trump transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment. For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com'}\n",

NOK and Motorola Solutions Inc. MSI.Ericsson is well-positioned to capitalize on the market momentum with a competitive 5G product portfolio. With a holistic growth focus, the company strives to be the leading telecommunications infrastructure provider worldwide and establish a focused enterprise business. One-Year Price Performance Image Source: Zacks Investment Research With the emergence of the smartphone market and subsequent usage of mobile broadband, user demand for coverage speed and quality has increased manifold. Further, there is a continuous need for network tuning and optimization to maintain superior performance as traffic increases. Ericsson is much in demand among operators to expand network coverage and upgrade networks for higher speed and capacity. It is reportedly the world’s largest supplier of LTE (Long-Term Evolution) technology with a significant market share and has established several LTE networks across the globe.\\xa0Ericsson is focusing on 5G system development and has undertaken many notable endeavors to position itself for market leadership on 5G. It currently has 170 live 5G networks across the globe, spanning 72 countries. The company believes that the standardization of 5G is the cornerstone for digitizing industries and broadband. The deployment of 5G networks is likely to boost the adoption of IoT (Internet of Things) devices, with technologies like network slicing gaining more prominence.\\xa0Ericsson continues to invest in the Enterprise business to make it a sizeable part of its business. The company has introduced on-demand network slicing capability in Android 14 devices. It empowers developers to enhance the flexibility of applications and allows service providers to better align network connectivity with user-specific requirements. Ericsson has inked a five-year contract worth $14 billion with AT&T Inc. T to modernize the latter’s network infrastructure. AT&T intends to leverage Ericsson technology to deploy a commercial-scale open radio access network (Open RAN) across the country to help build a more robust ecosystem of network infrastructure providers and suppliers. For Ericsson, the deal marks a remarkable achievement in outdoing rivals by embracing Open RAN technology to help create an open, agile, programmable wireless network.Ericsson has stepped up production in its 5G Smart factory in Lewisville, TX, to cater to the increased demand for 5G equipment with an additional $50 million investment, bringing it to the forefront of 5G innovation. With highly automated and efficient processes, the factory is fully powered by renewable electricity, producing next-generation 5G and Advanced Antenna System radios for Ericsson's U.S. customers. Earnings estimates for ERIC for 2024 have moved up 7.3% to 44 over the past 60 days, while the same for 2025 has remained steady at 51 cents. The positive estimate revision depicts bullish sentiments for the stock. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Ericsson operates in the highly competitive wireless equipment market. It has to cut its production costs and bring down its selling price to attract new customers in emerging markets while maintaining existing business relationships. The industry consolidation among customers and major rivals is posing a threat to Ericsson, intensifying price competition. Moreover, Ericsson operates in a dynamic market characterized by rapid technological changes, high product obsolescence and evolving standards, necessitating frequent product introductions and short product life cycles that substantially increase R&D costs and erode margins. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Ericsson’s business is likely to be affected by geopolitical turmoil and economic uncertainties in its operating countries. With a substantially lower market share, the company is witnessing a revenue decline in China in the Networks and Digital Services segments. Ericsson had warned that Sweden’s decision to exclude China-based vendors from Swedish 5G networks might adversely impact its business in the East Asian country. Disturbances in the supply chain are likely to further hamper its sales. It is also witnessing a revenue decline in the Middle East, Africa and India owing to lower capex spend from operators. By investing steadily in infrastructure for a leading 5G coverage, Ericsson is well-positioned to strengthen its leading market position. New 5G licensing agreements are driving growth in the Networks segment. Ericsson’s policy of strategic buyouts and continuous product innovation is accelerating commercial expansion with a holistic growth focus. The AT&T deal is further likely to drive organic growth. The uptrend in estimate revisions further portrays optimism about the stock’s growth potential.However, price wars owing to competitive pressure have eroded its profitability. Soft China market conditions are weighing on profitability. With a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), ERIC appears to be treading in the middle of the road, and investors could be better off if they trade with caution.

VZ.T-Mobile is poised to benefit from its “Un-carrier Value Proposition”, which aims to prioritize customer satisfaction by offering competitive pricing for the latest products and services. One-Year Price Performance Image Source: Zacks Investment Research T-Mobile continues to enhance its network infrastructure, including 5G and fiber networks, to provide best-in-class coverage and capacity across the nation. The infrastructure investments position it for growth by ensuring widespread access to its services, particularly in the rural region. T-Mobile's commitment to closing the digital divide underscores its dedication to fostering inclusive connectivity and driving socio-economic progress as the digital landscape evolves.\\xa0T-Mobile boasts a leadership position in the 5G market. The company’s 5G network covers 98% of Americans, or more than 330 million people in the country. Moreover, TMUS has an industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate. In the third quarter of 2024, the company added 1.6 million postpaid net customers while postpaid net account additions were 315,000, both metrics being the best in the industry. Its dedicated 5G spectrum assets, including the mid-band 2.5 GHz spectrum, deliver superfast speeds and extensive coverage with superior propagation. T-Mobile has inked a definitive agreement with United States Cellular Corporation USM to acquire substantially all of the latter’s wireless operations along with 30% of its spectrum assets across several spectrum bands. The transaction, worth $4.4 billion, is likely to close midway next year, subject to the fulfillment of mandatory closing conditions and other regulatory approvals.The transaction is likely to facilitate a competitive market with increased options and enable T-Mobile to expand its fast-growing home broadband offerings and fixed wireless products by tapping into the additional capacity and coverage created through the combined spectrum and wireless assets. The Un-carrier will also lease space on various US Cellular towers to ensure continued, uninterrupted customer service. In the third quarter of 2024, T-Mobile registered an adjusted free cash flow of $5.16 billion, up 32% year over year. This accentuates efficient capital management and implies that the company is well-positioned to invest in growth initiatives and pay debt and dividends.Backed by robust demand for its postpaid services and cost discipline, TMUS has presented a bullish outlook for fiscal 2024. The company expects postpaid net customer additions to be between 5.6 million and 5.8 million, up from 5.4 million and 5.7 million expected earlier. It anticipates cash from operating activities within $22-$22.3 billion compared with $21.8-$22.2 billion estimated earlier. TMUS expects adjusted free cash flow in the band of $16.7-$17 billion. Capital expenditure is projected to be in the range of $8.8-$9 billion. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Despite solid wireless traction, earnings estimates for TMUS for 2024 have moved down 5.2% to $9.38 over the past year, while the same for 2025 has declined 12% to $10.30. The negative estimate revision depicts bearish sentiments for the stock. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research To lure customers from competitors, T-Mobile has launched several low-priced service plans for consumers and small business entities. Moreover, management’s strategy of introducing several promotional activities such as free music streaming, video offers and price cuts on service plans and adoption of phone leasing plans, where equipment revenues are not booked upfront, creates a margin squeeze for the company. By investing steadily in infrastructure for a leading 5G coverage, T-Mobile is well-positioned to bridge the digital divide and enhance the connectivity landscape nationwide. This is likely to translate into continued industry-leading postpaid subscriber growth. A solid cash flow position and an aggressive inorganic growth policy further accentuate efficient capital management and augur well for the long-term growth of the company.However, a saturated wireless market and price wars owing to competitive pressure have eroded its profitability.

Shares have lost about 6.3% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500. Will the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is RTX due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers. RTX Beats on Q3 Earnings & Sales, Raises '24 Sales View RTX Corporation’s third-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.45 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33 by 9%. The bottom line also improved 16% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $1.25, driven by growth in adjusted segment operating profit and a lower effective tax rate. Including one-time items, the company reported GAAP earnings of $1.09 per share, marking an improvement from a loss of 68 cents in the prior-year quarter. The improvement can be attributed to higher sales, along with higher operating profit than the prior-year quarter’s levels. RTX’s third-quarter sales totaled $20.09 billion, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.91 billion by 0.9%. The top line also surged a solid 49.2% from $13.46 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023. The top-line improvement was driven by higher sales growth from RTX’s Pratt & Whitney and Collins Aerospace business segments. Total costs and expenses increased 22.4% year over year to $18.20 billion. The company generated an adjusted operating profit of $2.48 billion compared with $2.23 billion in the prior-year quarter. RTX posted an interest expense of $496 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $369 million in the prior-year quarter. Collins Aerospace: Sales in this segment totaled $7.08 billion, up 7% year over year.\\xa0 This improvement can be attributed to higher commercial aftermarket sales, backed by continued growth in commercial air traffic, including higher flight hours. Increased defense sales, driven by higher volumes across multiple programs, also contributed favorably to this unit’s sales growth. The segment’s adjusted operating profit totaled $1.10 billion compared with $1.04 billion in the year-ago quarter. Pratt & Whitney: This segment’s sales totaled $7.24 billion. This unit’s adjusted sales grew 14% from the year-ago quarter’s level. The improvement was due to sales growth in the commercial aftermarket and commercial OEM businesses, driven by a favorable OEM mix in large commercial engines, as well as higher aftermarket volumes. Increased military sales, driven by higher sustainment volume across the F35 and F117 platforms, as well as higher development volume driven by the F135 Engine Core Upgrade program contributed favorably to this unit’s sales growth. The adjusted operating profit was $597 million, up from $413 million in the year-ago quarter. Raytheon: This segment recorded sales of $6.39 billion, down 1% year over year, primarily due to the divestment of the Cybersecurity, Intelligence and Services business. The divestment was completed in the first quarter of 2024. Lower sales volume from air and space defense systems also hurt this unit’s sales performance. The segment’s adjusted operating profit amounted to $661 million compared with $570 million recorded in the corresponding period of 2023. RTX had cash and cash equivalents of $6.68 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, compared with $6.59 billion as of Dec. 31, 2023. The long-term debt totaled $38.82 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, down from $42.36 billion as of Dec 31, 2023. Net cash flow from operating activities was $5.60 billion as of Sept. 30, 2024, compared with $3.17 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2023. Free cash outflow totaled $4.04 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2024 compared with $1.56 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2023. RTX partially increased its financial guidance for 2024. The company now expects adjusted EPS to be in the band of $5.50-$5.58, up from the previous guidance of $5.35-$5.45. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 EPS is pegged at $5.45, which lies lower than the company’s guided range. RTX also increased its sales expectations to the band of $79.25-$79.75 billion for 2024 compared with the previous guidance of $78.75-$79.50 billion. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for sales is pegged at $79.46 billion, which lies below the midpoint of the company’s guided range. RTX still expects to generate free cash flow of $4.70 billion for 2024. It turns out, estimates review have trended downward during the past month. Currently, RTX has a nice Growth Score of B, a grade with the same score on the momentum front. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of B on the value side, putting it in the top 40% for this investment strategy. Overall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in. Estimates have been broadly trending downward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions indicates a downward shift. Notably, RTX has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Dramatic shifts in geopolitical, financial, and trade policies are going to transform the market, with trillions of dollars at stake. And nowhere is the anxiety more acute than among strategic companies, with Trump’s victory poised to give a boost to big banks and send defense sector stocks soaring. Meanwhile, the tech industry is a mixed bag and the oil and gas industry is set to do well under Trump. While readers might expect Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) to be among the biggest ‘Trump Trades’, the “Magnificent Seven” in general aren’t on our list. Our Top 3 picks are highly strategic and focused on the biggest elephant in the room: national security, defense, and heavy industry. #1 Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) Trump’s spending policies are expected to inject significant momentum into the defense industry, starting first with key manufacturers such as Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics, and Northrop Grumman. With a Trump victory, there will be a decidedly hawkish undertone to budget amounts for defense. With the Middle East threatening to explode into a wider regional conflict, with enough external actors to turn this into a world war, and with the Russia-Ukraine war still going strong and expanding into venues as far away as Africa, national defense has become a mainstream issue that captures voter sentiment more than it did the last time around. Lockheed Martin manufactures F-35 fighter aircraft, and it is already outperforming its peers and enjoying its share of the Pentagon’s recent $12-billion budget bonanza. In these times of geopolitical escalation, Lockheed is likely a buy under any president, but Trump could push it over the edge. #2 Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) Antimony is the “most important metal you’ve never heard of”, as Forbes has perfectly described it. It’s the national defense kingmaker, and Military Metals Corp. is uniquely positioned to supply what could be the most significant metal of our time. According to the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS), antimony is a highly critical element for the defense industry. It’s necessary for armor-piercing ammunition, infrared sensors, bullets, precision optics, nuclear weapons, semiconductors, cables, and batteries. Antimony prices exploded this year, rising well over 200% after Beijing slapped export restrictions on antimony, with the explicit intention of restricting global shipments to shore up China’s own natural security. This move has sent shockwaves through the tech and defense industries. Antimony is currently trading at over $35,000 a ton. The few companies active in the space have seen their share prices jump. Larvotta Resources, an Australian miner saw its share price explode 800% as China moved to restrict antimony exports, while Perpetua Resources, a Pentagon-backed miner saw its share price jump by more than 200% since the beginning of this year. Despite the major jump in antimony prices there are very few pure antimony plays in the market, but Military Metals Corp. (CSE:MILI; OTCQB:MILIF) stands out as a bold contender, aggressively building a portfolio of some of the most prolific, past-producing assets in Europe and North America. This ambitious explorer isn’t just gathering properties; it’s strategically seizing high-grade antimony and gold projects with historical impact such as the historical West Gore antimony mine, which was England’s largest supplier during World War I. Across the ocean in Europe, the company recently announced that it has purchased one of Europe’s largest antimony deposits in Slovakia. But the best thing here is the quality of the assets. Where development stage competitor Perpetua will mine antimony as a by-product at 0.06% per ton, the Slovakian properties of Military Metals Corp. easily reach up to 4% per ton of ore. According to Military Metals Corp. CEO Scott Eldridge, its assets are in the top three out of 15 companies globally in terms of quality of the assets. Confirming its reputation as a fast-mover,\\xa0 Military Metals Corp. announced the acquisition of another 388 hectares\\xa0 at its Nova Scotia West Gore project and has now “gained complete coverage over the entire mineralized system including all the historical mine workings and known antimony-gold occurrences”. Already earlier this month it made another acquisition, this time in Europe, where governments are just about as anxious about its future antimony supply as the United States. On October 7, 2024, Military Metals Corp. pushed onward with its rapid advance on antimony assets with an agreement to scoop up 100% ownership in a private company that owns two antimony projects in Slovakia, including a third tin asset. The Trojarova Antimony Project, Tienesgrund Antimony Project and the Medvedi Tin Project all have Soviet-era resources. The Trojarova project is one of the European’s Union’s largest historical Antimony resources. Source: Military Metals Corp. \"This acquisition strategically positions Military Metals as a leading explorer and developer of antimony,\" said CEO Scott Eldridge. \"The Trojarova and Tienesgrund projects offer significant potential for rapid advancement, particularly given Slovakia\\'s strong mining infrastructure and history. We see this as a perfect alignment with the European Union\\'s Critical Raw Materials Act, opening the door to potential EU funding sources as we advance these projects toward production.\" The company is rushing the antimony playing field here, moving at breakneck speed to acquire critical assets at the same time that China is tightening the reins on the rarest components of its national defense machine. With wildly escalating geopolitical tensions, coupled with Western sanctions on Russian metals, what makes it a ‘Trump Trade’ is the added impact a renewed tariff war would have on American antimony supplies if China decides to fight back. Speculative demand is at an all-time high, even as China grapples with a downturn in demand since it implemented export restrictions. With every hostile move from Beijing, we could expect antimony prices to rise further, creating significantly higher value for junior explorers and producers who have swooped in to take advantage of this national defense opportunity. #3 Nucor (NYSE:NUE) Back in August 2021, under Trump’s tenure, steel (HRC) was fetching around $2000 per ounce. Those days are gone. Today, it’s trading in the low $700s, and American steel producers need a lifeline for slowing sales and faltering growth. Trump could be that lifeline, and Nucor looks nicely positioned to reap the benefits. The American producer suffered this year, with revenue for the six months ended June 29 shedding 11% compared to the same period in 2023. Earnings per share have also taken a beating, down 40% from Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023. And Q3 earnings are expected to be worse, making this a good time to get in on the steel sector before it truly becomes a ‘Trump Trade’. There is a clear growth pathway here for Nucor, which is planning to invest $6.5 billion in eight major projects through 2027, but Trump policies would help bring the stock back up with the growth potential. A Trump promise of 10% tariffs on all important producers could reduce price competition pressure for Nucor, particularly emanating from producers based in China and Brazil. \"While market conditions have softened compared to recent record-setting years, Nucor remains focused on its long-term growth strategy and has returned more than $1.7 billion to investors through June,\" Nucor CEO Leon Topalian said in a second-quarter earnings release.

There are two kinds of companies producing America\\'s defense technology today. There are the “primes” — well-established defense giants like Boeing (BA), Lockheed Martin (LMT), General Dynamics (GD), RTX (RTX), and Northrop Grumman (NOC) — and there are the high-profile and fast-moving startups such as Anduril, which boasts 4,000 employees and a valuation of $14 billion only seven years after its founding. Investors are enthusiastic about this sector. Between 2021 and mid-June of this year, venture capitalists invested $130 billion in defense tech startups, according to PitchBook. How might a second Trump administration impact this industry? Schimpf said there is an opportunity for the Defense Department to reimagine how it procures military systems going forward. “Our view of this is let’s do what literally every free-market system has done,” he said. “Let’s just have the DOD be a better buyer. Buy the best tech. Show the entrepreneurs that if you build technology that actually works, that solves a real problem, we will actually buy it. And you have a chance to actually succeed doing that at scale.” This view echoes a post made by Tesla CEO Elon Musk (TSLA), who has closely aligned himself with Trump in recent months, on social platform X. Musk responded to Anduril founder Palmer Luckey, saying it is “Very important to open DoD/Intel to entrepreneurial companies like yours,” referencing the US Department of Defense and intelligence agencies. Schimpf’s company is built to capitalize on a belief that the future of war will be defined by relatively low-cost autonomous systems and not by high-cost, low-quantity fighter planes and aircraft carriers. Anduril has built a portfolio of such products, including counter-drone aircraft, autonomous submarines, and an autonomous security tower deployed on US military bases. Christopher Kirchhoff, who founded the Pentagon’s Silicon Valley office, told Yahoo Finance there is broad agreement inside the Pentagon that more resources should be shifted to the American defense tech community. However, there are political challenges. Kirchhoff noted that the Defense secretary would require strong allies inside the White House and on Capitol Hill to push forward meaningful change. “If you look at the amount of authority the [secretary of Defense] has, it’s actually very small,” Kirchhoff said. “Will the president actually exert leadership? Will Congress be receptive?

You probably don't think about the energy or resources required to manufacture those products, nor the resulting emissions and waste. Most discussions about healthcare are, understandably and rightfully, centered on its ability to restore health and save lives; rarely do we talk about its environmental impact. Yet, the healthcare sector is responsible for approximately 4.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions-the equivalent of 514 coal-fired power plants annually, with medical devices and technology among the drivers. And in the U.S., healthcare is the second largest contributor to landfill waste. It's time to get real about the reality that human health is linked to the health of the planet. We can't be committed to one without also being committed to the other. The same force that revolutionizes patient care holds the key to creating a more sustainable industry: innovation. Both of us have seen how approaching innovation, with a deliberate focus on sustainability, is better for people, the planet, and profits. Consider the automotive industry where many innovations have made electric vehicles more enjoyable to own and drive, while also providing a cleaner transportation solution. And healthcare, where virtual visits that arose as a necessity during the pandemic, are showing a positive impact on the environment, while also making care more convenient and accessible. So, how else can health tech make health better for you and the planet? Here are three not-so-simple ways: Recognize good things take time We know developing new healthcare technology requires patience and a substantial initial investment before we see long-term success. We need to apply this same mindset to sustainable technology. Some companies stick with existing solutions because new sustainable technologies are expensive or aren't ready for wide-scale adoption. That's why pilot projects are crucial stepping stones to broader implementation by giving sustainable technology the time it needs to mature and prove its effectiveness. Successful pilot projects often inspire a scalable roadmap for long-term cost efficiency. At the same time, we need to balance short-term financial pressures with long-term environmental goals. That means adopting a future-oriented view, recognizing today's technology will only get better and become more accessible and affordable over time. For example, innovations in solar panels over the past decade have made them significantly more cost-effective as a sustainable energy source. This has allowed Medtronic to install 22 solar arrays across 16 locations, generating more than 35 MWs of power-enough to power more than 22,000 homes. And we recently signed a virtual power purchase agreement which adds renewable energy at a scale equivalent to nearly all our U.S. energy needs. Companies that make these strategic investments today, with the same patience and investment they apply to product development, are setting themselves up for greater growth and profits down the line. Reimagine products and packaging Sustainable product and packaging design are some of our industry's most complex challenges due to strict regulatory requirements that restrict circular design solutions. Companies can begin reducing resource use and waste with takeback programs, recycling product components and transitioning to digital instructions for use. But the goal isn't just to reduce waste-it's to create products that maintain the highest standards of patient care while contributing to a circular economy. To do that, we need to design products and packaging with their end-of-life journey in mind, whether that's reprocessing, recycling, or biodegradation. It's important to remember there are many ways to reach sustainability goals and although reprocessing is becoming more common practice, sometimes single use devices can be the right option, especially if reprocessing increases risk to patient safety. It is the conscious actions at the beginning that count a lot-for example, designing for sustainability before the first prototype is even developed. Industry leaders are dedicating R&D teams to spot opportunities for circular solutions within products' lifecycles, like the Sustainability Development Center at Medtronic. (Learn more in our latest Impact Report.) Recruit partners No one can solve our industry's environmental challenges alone. It requires collaboration across the healthcare ecosystem. This starts with our supply chains, given that Scope 3 emissions typically account for over 90% of a healthcare technology company's carbon footprint, including at Medtronic. Engaging suppliers, logistic partners, employees and customers will not only help address emissions, but it will also build resilience against future risks that threaten supply chain stability. We also need to think beyond our own value chain and look to others in the industry, academia, civil society, and government to develop breakthrough solutions and new enabling policies and incentive frameworks. For example, the Dutch government's ESCH-R: Creating Circular Hospitals Together program is helping address critical circularity gaps in healthcare with sponsorship from industry partners (including Medtronic). Collaborative approaches like this are key to building the infrastructure, developing the technologies, and creating the standards needed for a collective impact. The transformation to sustainable healthcare won't happen overnight, but momentum is building, and it will grow because it is good for business and good for the planet. Together, we can create a healthcare technology industry that heals not only people but also the planet we all share. After all, the healthiest future is one where innovation and sustainability are inseparable.

One way to find winning stocks based on your preferred way of investing is to use the Zacks Style Scores, which are indicators that rate stocks based on three widely-followed investing types: value, growth, and momentum. Different than growth or momentum investors, value-focused investors are all about finding good stocks at good prices, and discovering which companies are trading under what their true value is before the broader market catches on. The Value Style Score utilizes ratios like P/E, PEG, Price/Sales, and Price/Cash Flow to help pick out the most attractive and discounted stocks. In 2015, Medtronic, Inc. (the legacy NYSE-listed parent company, incorporated in Minnesota) acquired Ireland-based Covidien plc for cash and stock of $49.9 billion. The acquisition resulted in the formation of a new holding company incorporated in Ireland called Medtronic plc (the new Irish tax resident, NYSE-listed parent company holding both the legacy Medtronic and Covidien). MDT sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), holds a Value Style Score of B, and has a VGM Score of B. Compared to the Medical - Products industry's P/E of 25.4X, shares of Medtronic are trading at a forward P/E of 15.4X. MDT also has a PEG Ratio of 2.4, a Price/Cash Flow ratio of 11.7X, and a Price/Sales ratio of 3.3X. Value investors don't just pay attention to a company's valuation ratios; positive earnings play a crucial role, too. Three analysts revised their earnings estimate upwards in the last 60 days for fiscal 2025. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has increased $0.00 to $5.46 per share. MDT has an average earnings surprise of 2%. With strong valuation and earnings metrics, a good Zacks Rank, and top-tier Value and VGM Style Scores, investors should strongly think about adding MDT to their portfolios.

After years of portfolio optimization, I\\'ve identified three dividend stocks with such powerful competitive advantages and consistent execution that they\\'ve earned permanent positions in my portfolio. Here\\'s why these three elite dividend payers will remain cornerstones of my investment strategy for decades to come. Start Your Mornings Smarter!\\xa0Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.\\xa0Sign Up For Free » Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) might seem like a pass with its modest 0.5% dividend yield and lofty 52 forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). However, I\\'m never parting with my shares because this company has built an unshakeable competitive advantage through its membership model and relentless focus on customer value. Moreover, Costco\\'s stellar 12.3% five-year dividend growth rate and a rock-bottom payout ratio of 26.3% demonstrate management\\'s commitment to rewarding shareholders. The proof is in the numbers. A $10,000 investment in Costco 10 years ago would be worth $81,960 today with dividends reinvested in a tax-advantaged account -- more than double the S&P 500\\'s performance over this period. What truly excites me about Costco\\'s future is how the company keeps finding ways to deepen customer loyalty. Take their famous $4.99 rotisserie chicken. Costco\\'s former CFO Richard Galanti openly called it an \"investment in low prices to drive membership.\" This laser focus on member value has created a virtuous cycle that I believe will continue delivering returns for decades. Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) represents my bet on an unstoppable trend -- the global shift to digital payments. With a 0.76% dividend yield and an impressive 15.4% five-year dividend growth rate, Visa combines rapidly growing income with a bulletproof market position. I\\'m holding Visa stock forever because its network effects create an almost insurmountable barrier to entry. Furthermore, the global digital payment market is projected to grow at a sizzling 21.1% annual rate through 2030. Visa\\'s entrenched position in payment infrastructure makes it a prime beneficiary of this high-powered growth trend. With two-thirds of adults worldwide already making digital payments and numerous countries moving away from cash payments, I see decades of growth ahead for this digital-payments juggernaut. Medtronic plc (NYSE: MDT) stands out in my portfolio for its combination of innovation leadership and reliable income. The company\\'s 3.2% dividend yield and 5.97% five-year dividend growth rate provide a compelling mix of current income and future growth potential, even with its elevated 93.2% payout ratio. What keeps me invested for the long haul is Medtronic\\'s proven ability to expand into new markets by adapting existing technologies. The company consistently finds novel applications for its core technologies while maintaining its position as the largest pure-play medical-device maker globally. While Medtronic\\'s stock performance over the prior 10 years has been modest (see graph below), I believe its deep research pipeline and strategic shift toward risk-based contracting will drive growth for years to come. These three companies demonstrate why I believe the hardest part of dividend investing is simply sitting still. Costco offers a modest yield but explosive dividend growth, while Visa provides steady dividend increases backed by an expanding global opportunity. Medtronic delivers higher current income with industry-leading levels of innovation. Together, they form a dividend portfolio I\\'m confident in holding for the next several decades. Their different strengths -- Costco\\'s loyalty moat, Visa\\'s network effects, and Medtronic\\'s innovation engine -- provide diversification while sharing one crucial quality: sustainable competitive advantages that grow stronger over time. For investors seeking truly permanent portfolio holdings, these three dividend stalwarts deserve serious consideration.

The system offers personalised and real-time insights for individuals managing diabetes through MDI therapies. It combines the company’s InPen smart insulin pen with its Simplera continuous glucose monitor (CGM), a disposable, all-in-one device. The MDI system is poised to be the first on the market to offer recommendations for correcting missed or inaccurate insulin doses. For diabetic individuals, taking insulin injections before meals is crucial to maintain glucose levels and prevent post-meal blood sugar spikes. Despite their importance, it is estimated that one out of three doses are missed regularly. The Smart MDI system\\'s ‘Missed Dose alert’ aims to reduce these occurrences, thereby mitigating the risk of diabetes-related complications. Medtronic plans to initially roll out the Smart MDI system to existing standalone CGM and InPen customers, with a broader commercial launch to follow. In September 2023, the company announced the CE mark approval for the Simplera CGM. The no-fingerstick sensor does not require additional tape and is compatible with iOS and Android platforms, designed for individuals aged two years and older. Using Bluetooth technology, InPen communicates with a mobile app, which assists in dose calculations and tracking. The app also includes a missed meal dose identification feature. The app is said to determine the optimal dose of insulin based on glucose levels, carbohydrate intake, and insulin already active in the body, thereby helping to manage diabetes without the use of a pump. Its precision allows for dosage decisions in half-units and enables automatic logging of doses, and reminders for insulin administration while providing insights into how diet and activity affect blood sugar levels. \"Medtronic’s insulin pen app gains FDA clearance\" was originally created and published by Medical Device Network, a GlobalData owned brand.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) stands against other Ken Griffin's portfolio stocks to buy. Ken Griffin, the visionary founder of\\xa0Citadel Investment Group, launched his hedge fund in 1990 with $4.2 million, achieving unprecedented success. In 2022, Griffin’s fund delivered an extraordinary 153% return, driven by accurate bets on inflation and interest rates. With a portfolio now exceeding $518 billion, Citadel Investment Group is one of Wall Street’s most closely watched hedge funds, consistently achieving over 25% annual returns since 2016. Citadel employs a multi-strategy investment approach, combining long and short positions to capitalize on market opportunities.\\xa0Its flagship fund, Wellington, anchors Citadel’s operations by investing across multiple asset classes and sectors, emphasizing diversification. In 2022, Wellington achieved an impressive 38% return, building on 26% in 2021 and 24% in 2020. Notably, the fund posted a 19.4% gain in 2019, more than double its 9.1% return in 2018. While Griffin’s legacy is strongly tied to Citadel’s hedge fund, a significant portion of his Forbes-calculated net worth comes from Citadel Securities, valued at $22 billion after Sequoia and Paradigm acquired a small stake two years ago. Citadel Securities has redefined modern trading, challenging the traditional dominance of big banks. In just two decades, it has become the largest stock buyer and seller in the U.S.; in August, it facilitated more equity trading within its electronic network than the New York Stock Exchange’s main market. In 2023, Citadel Securities generated $2.8 billion in profit from $6.3 billion in net revenue, with an impressive $4.9 billion in net revenue achieved in the first half of 2024 alone.

The billionaire also ranks among the top donors to outside spending groups for the 2024 election, which secured former President Donald Trump a second term. As the founder and CEO of Citadel, he contributed $100 million to conservative causes, making him the fifth-largest individual contributor to federal election spending, according to Federal Election Commission data. While Griffin has donated millions to Republican candidates, particularly since 2022, he has notably refrained from directly supporting Trump’s campaign. A self-described “Reagan Republican,” Griffin has historically favored establishment-focused Super PACs, such as the Congressional Leadership Fund. For this our list of the 10 best stocks in Ken Griffin’s portfolio, we examined Citadel Investment Group’s stock portfolio from the third quarter of 2024. The stocks are ranked based on the firm’s stake value in each holding. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

Citadel Investment Group’s Stake: $524 million Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) is a leading global medical technology company specializing in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of device-based medical therapies. It is a pioneer in robotic-assisted surgery technologies, with significant advancements in minimally invasive and spine procedures. In the latest quarter, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) achieved a 5.3% year-over-year revenue increase, driven by balanced growth across its Surgical, Neuroscience, Cardiovascular, and Diabetes segments. The company’s international operations account for 48% of its total revenue, underscoring its global reach and diversified revenue streams. On October 15, Baird raised its price target for Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) to $96 from $90 while maintaining a Neutral rating. The adjustment reflects Medtronic’s consistent mid-single-digit top-line growth over the past seven quarters. Baird’s analysis suggests the company is likely to surpass consensus expectations for Q2 FY2025 revenue and adjusted earnings per share. However, the firm noted the cautious tone of Medtronic’s FY2025 guidance and highlighted the sustainability of the projected high-single-digit adjusted EPS growth for the latter half of the fiscal year. Overall, MDT ranks 9th on our list of Ken Griffin's portfolio stocks to buy. While we acknowledge the potential of MDT, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

That would be the third-biggest harvest on record, and is about 1 million tons higher that what the group was expecting in September, when a lack of spring rain was threatening output. An unexpected increase in wheat exports from Australia may help alleviate concerns about potential disruptions to shipments from the Black Sea region as the war in Ukraine intensifies. Wheat futures are on track for their biggest weekly gain in two months due to nervousness over the escalating conflict. Wheat crops are yielding more than expected, said agronomist and GIWA report writer Michael Lamond, who lives on a farm on the western rim of the grain belt. “The leaves didn’t look to great prior to harvest, with damaged and yellowing leaves. But they’re yielding well.” The Western Australian harvest has, however, been delayed by heavy rain this week. Those wet conditions are expected to continue into next week, according to weather forecaster Maxar.

Here's what you need to know\", 'Publisher': 'LA Times', 'Link': 'https://finance.yahoo.com/m/6872f31c-b9ed-3f52-8010-7943ff16c265/google-could-be-forced-to.html', 'Provider Publish Time': 1732232560, 'Type': 'STORY', 'Related Tickers': 'GOOG', 'Text': 'Google and federal officials are battling it out over a proposal that the tech giant be forced to sell its popular Chrome web browser to restore competition to the online search market. The proposal, filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and several states this week, came after a federal judge ruled that Google maintained an illegal monopoly over internet search. The landmark decision opened the door to the current showdown over potential remedies that could reshape the tech giant\\'s multibillion-dollar business. As part of their proposed penalties, Justice Department officials also suggested the judge impose restrictions on Android, Google\\'s mobile operating system, to prevent it from favoring Google products. The Department of Justice says forcing Google to divest Chrome would create more competition and stop the search giant\\'s control over a \"browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet.\" Google pushed back, calling the request an \"unprecedented government overreach\" that would harm consumers and U.S. tech leadership. \"This is to some extent a negotiating dance,\" said George Hay, a Cornell University law professor and antitrust expert. \"The DOJ is probably trying to get Google to be more cooperative in coming up with remedies that will fix the problem.\" Here\\'s what you need to know: What are U.S. officials proposing? The Justice Department outlined for the judge several possible solutions in its 23-page court filing, including forcing Google to sell Chrome and potentially Android as well if the company does not adequately address its practice of requiring smartphone makers to use Google products embedded in Android. \"The playing field is not level because of Google’s conduct, and Google’s quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,\" the filing says. \"The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.\" The Justice Department wants to bar Google from entering into exclusive agreements with content publishers, as well as owning or acquiring any interests in search rivals. Publishers should also be able to opt out of having Google use their content to train artificial intelligence tools, under the proposal. And Justice Department officials want advertisers to have more access to data and control over ads that show up in Google search results. The Justice Department is trying to make consumers more aware of choices outside of Google, the world\\'s most popular search engine. Another potential fix includes requiring Google to display a \"choice screen\" on every Google browser when a user hasn\\'t selected a default search engine. What\\'s Google\\'s response? Google thinks the government\\'s proposal goes too far. Instead, the company thinks the government should focus solutions more narrowly on agreements it has with Apple, Mozilla, smartphone manufacturers and wireless carriers that require the companies to favor Google\\'s search engine over others. Kent Walker, chief legal officer at Google and its parent company, Alphabet, in a blog post called the government\\'s proposal a \"radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America’s global technology leadership.\" Google opposes the idea that it should install \"choice screens\" on its browser and alleges that would hinder people\\'s abilities to use the company\\'s products. Will this affect the way I search online? Because Google\\'s punishment hasn\\'t been decided, it is too early to say how internet search could be affected. Antitrust experts said it depends on what remedies the judge in the case decides on and whether they withstand scrutiny by an appeals court. Some experts questioned whether any changes, even a forced sale of Chrome, would be effective in getting people to use other search engines. \"It will still be there in some way, shape or form, but it may be more subtle in terms of the effects on consumers,\" said Shubha Ghosh, a law professor at Syracuse University. It\\'s unclear who is interested in buying Google Chrome, which Bloomberg reported could be worth up to $20 billion. Could the Trump administration affect Google\\'s punishment? Possibly. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized Google over allegations that the search giant censors conservative speech, which the company has repeatedly denied. But Trump, who reportedly took a phone call with Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai after he won the U.S. presidential election, has also stopped short of saying he would break up the search giant. “It’s a very dangerous thing because we want to have great companies,” Trump said in an October interview moderated by Bloomberg News. “We don’t want China to have these companies. Right now, China is afraid of Google.” Hay said he doesn\\'t anticipate Trump will pull the plug on the case, but the Justice Department could soften its proposed remedies. What happens next? Google said it will file its own proposals next month. Court hearings on Google\\'s punishment are scheduled to begin in April. Judge Amit Mehta of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, who is overseeing the case, is expected to make a decision on Google\\'s punishment by August 2025.

Shares of Google-parent Alphabet plunged over 5% Thursday after prosecutors outlined proposed remedies that would significantly alter how the search giant conducts its business. In September, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled Google had illegally monopolized the search market with tens of billions of dollars in payments to ensure it remained the default search engine on smartphones and web browsers. Beyond calling for a stop to those practices, the DOJ also wants to stop Google from making itself the default search option on its line of Pixel smartphones. Most notably, however, the agency also called on the judge to force the company to sell its flagship Chrome browser. Alphabet’s Class C shares closed the day down 4.5% and then dropped further in after-hours trading. In response, chief legal officer Kent Walker said the proposed remedies would endanger Americans' security and privacy, as well as chill the company’s investments in artificial intelligence. “DOJ’s approach would result in unprecedented government overreach that would harm American consumers, developers, and small businesses—and jeopardize America’s global economic and technological leadership at precisely the moment it’s needed most,” he said in a statement posted on the company’s website. Ironically, the ruling on the anticompetitive payments, which Google terms “traffic acquisition costs,” could potentially help the company’s bottom line. Those expenses totaled $40 billion in the first nine months of 2024, according to Baron’s, or nearly 40% of the company’s cost of revenue. Taking those off the table would immediately boost gross margins. But owning Chrome, the world’s most popular web browser, helps power Google’s ads business, the company’s largest source of revenue. It's also how the company has introduced many consumers to its main AI offering, Gemini, which currently summarizes results to queries and may eventually follow users around the web. However, a theoretical sale could prove difficult to execute. As Bloomberg noted, most of the companies who could afford the potential deal, including the likes of Amazon, are already under antirust scrutiny themselves. Regardless of whether Judge Mehta approves the remedies—a judgement is expected in August 2025—Google says it plans to appeal. It’s unclear how the incoming Trump administration will view the case, given that it started during the President-elect’s first term and then continued under Biden.

Ken Griffin, the visionary founder of\\xa0Citadel Investment Group, launched his hedge fund in 1990 with $4.2 million, achieving unprecedented success. In 2022, Griffin’s fund delivered an extraordinary 153% return, driven by accurate bets on inflation and interest rates. With a portfolio now exceeding $518 billion, Citadel Investment Group is one of Wall Street’s most closely watched hedge funds, consistently achieving over 25% annual returns since 2016. Citadel employs a multi-strategy investment approach, combining long and short positions to capitalize on market opportunities.\\xa0Its flagship fund, Wellington, anchors Citadel’s operations by investing across multiple asset classes and sectors, emphasizing diversification. In 2022, Wellington achieved an impressive 38% return, building on 26% in 2021 and 24% in 2020. Notably, the fund posted a 19.4% gain in 2019, more than double its 9.1% return in 2018. While Griffin’s legacy is strongly tied to Citadel’s hedge fund, a significant portion of his Forbes-calculated net worth comes from Citadel Securities, valued at $22 billion after Sequoia and Paradigm acquired a small stake two years ago. Citadel Securities has redefined modern trading, challenging the traditional dominance of big banks. In just two decades, it has become the largest stock buyer and seller in the U.S.; in August, it facilitated more equity trading within its electronic network than the New York Stock Exchange’s main market. In 2023, Citadel Securities generated $2.8 billion in profit from $6.3 billion in net revenue, with an impressive $4.9 billion in net revenue achieved in the first half of 2024 alone.

As the founder and CEO of Citadel, he contributed $100 million to conservative causes, making him the fifth-largest individual contributor to federal election spending, according to Federal Election Commission data. While Griffin has donated millions to Republican candidates, particularly since 2022, he has notably refrained from directly supporting Trump’s campaign. A self-described “Reagan Republican,” Griffin has historically favored establishment-focused Super PACs, such as the Congressional Leadership Fund.

Its recent acquisitions are expected to drive revenue growth in the long term. Meanwhile, headwinds, such as currency movements and dull macroeconomic conditions, raise concern for Boston Scientific. In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 66.1% compared with the industry’s 21.4% growth and the S&P 500 composite’s 29.2% gain. The renowned manufacturer of medical devices and products has a market capitalization of $128.21 billion. BSX beat on earnings in each of the trailing four quarters, delivering an average surprise of 8.29%. Let’s delve deeper. Impressive Value-Adding Acquisitions: Boston Scientific’s impressive recent acquisitions have added numerous products with immense potential. This, in turn, should help boost the top line in the long term. The company’s recently completed strategic buyouts include a $3.7 billion acquisition of Axonics. This acquisition is aimed at expanding BSX’s differentiated technologies portfolio within Urology. Additionally, the company completed the acquisition of Silk Road Medical for $1.16 billion. This acquisition should help the company progress in vascular medicine, where Silk Road has revolutionized stroke prevention and the treatment of carotid artery disease. International Expansion Continues: Boston Scientific successfully expands operations across different geographies outside the United States. The company is putting additional efforts to expand its foothold in the emerging markets (which are defined as all countries except the United States, Western and Central Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Canada) that hold strong growth potentials based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors and global capabilities. Despite geopolitical weaknesses in the third quarter of 2024, the emerging market registered sturdy growth, primarily banking on continued broad-based momentum across the company’s business and investment in this region. During this period, emerging markets' net sales grew nearly 16.8% year over year on an operational basis. In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Boston Scientific is successfully expanding its base on the back of its diverse portfolio, new launches and commercial execution with healthy underlying market demand. In the third quarter, EMEA sales grew 14.3% year over year on an operational basis, banking on above-market performance in Electrophysiology. In Asia Pacific, Boston Scientific is particularly registering strong growth in China, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. It also grew in the mid-teens despite recent volume-based procurement implementations. Exposure to Currency Movement: Boston Scientific records 40% of its sales from the international market. Therefore, it remains highly exposed to currency fluctuations. Unfavorable currency movements have been a major dampener over the past few quarters. In the second quarter, the company had a 160 basis-point impact on revenues from unfavorable currency fluctuations.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Macroeconomic Headwinds Dent Growth: Difficult macroeconomic conditions, international conflicts, unstable financial market dynamics and volatility in the price and availability of goods and services are laying pressure on Boston Scientific’s profitability. With such sustained macroeconomic pressures, the company may struggle to keep its operating expenses in check. In the third quarter of 2024, the company reported a 19.2% rise in the cost of products sold. Further, selling, general and administrative expenses rose 25.8%, resulting in a 123 basis point contraction in operating margin. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has increased 2.5% to $2.46 per share in the past 30 days. The consensus estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $16.58 billion, which indicates a 16.4% increase from the year-ago reported numbers. Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Globus Medical GMED and Penumbra PEN. Haemonetics has an earnings yield of 5.02% compared with the industry’s 1.18%.

The trial data provided clinical evidence indicating that LAAC with the WATCHMAN FLX device is safe and superior to oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy for reducing the risk of long-term bleeding events in patients who have undergone an ablation. The OPTION trial data were presented at the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions 2024 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Following the announcement, shares of BSX moved north 4% to $90.45 yesterday. The company’s structural heart programs are building momentum, banking on the strong performance of the WATCHMAN LAAC device. The next-generation WATCHMAN FLX and FLX Pro are strongly capturing the global market. In the third quarter of 2024, WATCHMAN’s organic sales grew 18% year over year. Accordingly, we expect market sentiment to remain positive surrounding the announcement. BSX currently has a market capitalization of $128.1 billion. It has an earnings yield of 17.1%, much higher than the industry’s 12.6%. The trial met the primary safety endpoint of non-procedural major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding at 36 months. In line with this, the WATCHMAN FLX device was found to be superior to OAC. Notably, trial data showed high rates of procedural success in patients who had a WATCHMAN FLX implant after an ablation, which reinforced positive outcomes such as low rates of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke within the trial population. These positive primary outcomes indicate that patients receiving the WATCHMAN FLX device can eliminate long-term medication use while maintaining stroke protection. With this positive data, the company aims to expand the indication for the WATCHMAN FLX platform. The randomized, controlled OPTION trial included 1,600 patients enrolled across 114 sites in the United States, Europe and Australia. In the trial, approximately 60% of device patients had their WATCHMAN FLX implant 90-180 days following their ablation procedure. Nearly 40% of the other device patients had the two procedures performed concomitantly, with the WATCHMAN FLX implant taking place after the ablation. The study compared the device with first-line OAC therapy, which included direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) (95%) and warfarin (5%) for stroke risk reduction in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation following a cardiac ablation. In addition to the OPTION trial, the WATCHMAN technology is being evaluated against DOAC therapy in lower-risk patients within the CHAMPION-AF randomized trial. The latest-generation WATCHMAN FLX Pro LAAC device is similarly being studied in several clinical trials, including the SIMPLAAFY randomized controlled trial, which is evaluating a single-drug alternative to dual antiplatelet therapy as a post-procedural regimen.  Image Source: Zacks Investment Research According to a Precedence Research report, the global left atrial appendage closure devices market is projected to grow around $7.01 billion by 2034, at a compound annual growth rate of 14.1% from 2024 to 2034. The rising prevalence of atrial fibrillation and rising government initiatives contribute to the market's growth. Technological advancements are also promoting growth. The company recently acquired Axonics, Inc. at an equity value of $3.7 billion. In the past year, shares of BSX have risen 66.1% compared with the industry’s 21.4% growth.

The deal, originally announced in January this year, enables Boston Scientific’s entry into sacral neuromodulation (SNM), a high-growth adjacency for its Urology business. The company paid $71 cash per share to Axonics, representing an equity value of $3.7 billion and an enterprise value of $3.3 billion. The transaction is expected to be immaterial to adjusted earnings per share in 2024 and 2025 and accretive thereafter. However, on a GAAP basis, Boston Scientific anticipates the transaction to be less accretive or more dilutive due to amortization expenses and acquisition-related charges. After the Nov. 15 announcement, shares of BSX jumped 3.3%, finishing at $90.45 in yesterday’s session. \\xa0Boston Scientific is consistently gaining market share within its MedSurg segment. Within Urology, the Stone Management and Prostate Health franchises are growing well owing to the strong performances of Rezum and SpaceOAR. The Endoscopy business is also gaining from strong worldwide demand for its broad range of gastrointestinal and pulmonary treatment options.\\xa0We expect the market sentiment toward BSX stock to remain positive surrounding this development. Boston Scientific currently has a market capitalization of $128.21 billion. The company has an estimated 2024 earnings growth of 20% compared to the industry’s 11.4% growth. It delivered an earnings beat of 8.29%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. Irvine, CA-headquartered Axonics’ products are available in more than 20 countries. The portfolio includes SNM therapy for overactive bladder (OAB) and incontinence, which is a minimally invasive procedure that works by delivering mild electrical pulses to the sacral nerve to restore communication between the brain and the bladder. The company launched its first rechargeable SNM device for OAB in November 2019 and treated nearly 100,000 incontinence patients globally in 2023. Axonics reported net revenues of approximately\\xa0$366 million last year, growing 34% over 2022 with attractive gross margins. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The latest acquisition is strategic and financially compelling for Boston Scientific, expanding its ability to offer clinically differentiated treatment options with well-established therapies in a high-growth adjacency. In the United States, the market for SNM is large and significantly underpenetrated, presenting a major opportunity for Boston Scientific to leverage its global reach and capabilities to accelerate the awareness and adoption of Axonics technologies. Per a research report, the global sacral nerve stimulation (SNS) market was valued at $1.6 billion in 2023 and is expected to witness a compound annual rate of 11.5% by 2030. The market growth is attributed to the increasing rates of overactive bladder conditions and the incidence of urge incontinence, including UTIs. Advancements in technology and increased awareness of SNS as an effective treatment option enhance its adoption. This month, Boston Scientific announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Cortex, Inc., an Ajax Health company.\\xa0Cortex has developed the OptiMap System, which uses a basket catheter and proprietary algorithm to identify potential active AF (atrial fibrillation) sources, providing physicians with precise insights to efficiently deliver an individualized ablation strategy for their patients.\\xa0The company expects to complete the transaction in the first half of 2025, subject to customary closing conditions. In the past year, Boston Scientific shares have surged 66.1% compared with the industry’s growth of 21.4%. Boston Scientific currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Penumbra PEN, Haemonetics HAE and Globus Medical GMED, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

At least that\\'s according to a report by investment bank Morgan Stanley, which estimates the brain-computer interface (BCI) market could be the next opportunity for investors, with a total addressable market of $400 billion. \"This is, to us, the next big opportunity in med tech — and it\\'s rare,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Kallum Titchmarsh told Yahoo Finance. \"BCIs have been in development for 100 years essentially. When you are five years away from full commercial launches, I think it\\'s time to get excited and get ahead of the curve.\" Titchmarsh covers medical technology stocks, such as Inari Medical (NARI), Penumbra (PEN), Sight Sciences (SGHT), Irhythm Technologies (IRTC), Nevro (NVRO), Inspire Medical Systems (INSP), and Embecta (EMBC), at Morgan Stanley. The report, published last month, estimates the commercial launch of BCIs in about five years. \"On our numbers, we expect just under $1.5 billion of revenue to be generated from BCI implant procedures out to 2035 (hitting north of a $500 million annual run rate in 2036), and hitting the $1 billion annual run rate by 2041,\" the report said. \"To us, these numbers seem very plausible, particularly when compared to existing med tech end markets...\" Analysts told Yahoo Finance that several neuro-technology companies are vying to be the Apple (AAPL) of their industry. Titchmarsh estimates the penetration will be limited in the first 20 years of launch — likely sitting at less than 3% by 2045. \"But still, this is such a large target market, you don\\'t really need too much penetration to be generating quite significant revenues,\" he said. Morgan Stanley broke the market into two categories: enabling BCIs and preventative BCIs. Enabling BCIs would help patients who have already lost their ability to move or speak as a result of a severe neurological disease or traumatic injury. Preventative BCIs would stop conditions such as depression and epilepsy. Initial applications will help those with motor neuron disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (40,000 and 30,000 people), spinal cord injury (300,000), stroke (900,000), multiple sclerosis (1 million), cerebral palsy (500,000), limb amputation (2.5 million), epilepsy (3 million), and depression (21 million, 2.5 million with severe treatment-resistant). \"In the future, there will be no phones, just Neuralinks,\" Elon Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, in June. Musk co-founded BCI company Neuralink in 2016, which is now valued at a reported $8 billion. There are several others making big strides that are backed by the richest people in the world. Synchron, a company that implants its chip through the blood vessels with no drilling of the skull, has its Series C funding round backed by Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. The company has an estimated valuation of about $400 million. Palantir (PLTR) co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel has poured at least $10 million into Blackrock Neurotech, which sports a valuation of a reported $350 million. German billionaire Christian Angermayer is on the board of Blackrock Neurotech and is also an investor. Titchmarsh is focusing on four players he says currently lead the pack: Neuralink, Synchron, Precision Neuroscience, and Paradromics. \"I think being first is super important,\" Titchmarsh said, adding that whichever company is first to market will get the foothold on reimbursement. \"It\\'s rare to see four or five players in a med tech space compete. It is more likely we\\'ll see probably three.\" He expects that within the first few years of a commercial launch, the market will be narrowed down to three key players. Beyond that the likelihood of acquisitions by public companies is high. \"Three large companies have neuromodulation businesses: Medtronic, Abbott, and Boston Scientific,\" Titchmarsh said. \"But this seems very unique of a market, and it may actually be better in the hands of these companies as kind of pure plays for now so that it doesn\\'t get lost in the broader development pipeline. Would I be surprised in 10 years if one of these large med tech companies had a BCI? Not at all.\" Last month, Precision Neuroscience closed a $93 million funding round, valuing the startup at around $500 million. \"We view brain-computer interfaces as a generationally important life sciences innovation and one that really is ... going to have applicability today in paralysis, tomorrow in a number of different areas,\" Michael Mager, co-founder and CEO of Precision Neuroscience, told me at Yahoo Finance\\'s Invest conference (video above). \"We tried to build this company from the very beginning to go the distance.\" Catch more in-depth conversations from Yahoo Finance\\'s Invest conference Precision has temporarily implanted its device, called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, into more than two dozen patients during clinical trials. The company uses a minimally invasive approach that doesn\\'t penetrate the brain like its competitors. Precision Neuroscience\\'s co-founder and chief science officer, Benjamin Rapoport (formerly of Neuralink), said the technology goes beyond med tech. \"There\\'s an aspect of it that is novel manufacturing techniques,\" Rapoport, a practicing neurosurgeon, told Yahoo Finance. \"There\\'s an aspect of it that is supply chain related. There\\'s a significant aspect of it that\\'s artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven. We\\'re pushing so many limits on all these fronts that there\\'s not really any other, to date, field or technology in medicine that has required innovation on so many levels at the same time.\" Precision is awaiting FDA approval to implant its chip in patients for up to 30 days. Rapoport expects the cost of a BCI to be six figures. \"For the economic impact on a young person, who has probably 50 years of life and maybe 35 years of work ahead of them, what you\\'re giving them and their family is a level of independence and economic self-sufficiency,\" Rapoport said. \"And that\\'s worth a year or two salary — I think most people would agree.\" Yasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away. If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Boston Scientific (NYSE:BSX). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Boston Scientific managed to grow EPS by 16% per year, over three years. That's a good rate of growth, if it can be sustained. It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. While we note Boston Scientific achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 16% to US$16b. That's encouraging news for the company! In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image. Of course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Boston Scientific. Since Boston Scientific has a market capitalisation of US$128b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$239m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value. As previously touched on, Boston Scientific is a growing business, which is encouraging. To add an extra spark to the fire, significant insider ownership in the company is another highlight. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists.

Boston Scientific’s Watchman left atrial appendage (LAA) closure device to prevent stroke resulted in significantly less bleeding after an ablation procedure than taking blood thinners, according to a new study. The trial, led by the Cleveland Clinic and funded by Boston Scientific, is the first to compare LAA closure to oral anticoagulants in patients who had an ablation procedure to treat atrial fibrillation (AFib), an irregular heartbeat that increases stroke risk. Both arms of the study had low rates of stroke, blood clots and death, which is good news for patients, Oussama Wazni, vice chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, told MedTech Dive. “The main takeaway is that now we have a choice after an ablation. When a patient is concerned about continuing oral anticoagulation, we have a choice of a device, and you won\\'t need to take blood thinners long-term,” said Wazni, the study\\'s principal investigator. The findings were presented Saturday at the American Heart Association’s Scientific Sessions and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine. More patients with AFib are undergoing cardiac ablation to treat the condition, but guidelines recommend those at high risk for stroke remain on blood thinners afterward in case of AFib recurrence. However, long-term use of blood thinners poses a risk of serious bleeding. “Regardless of ablation or no ablation, 25% of patients who should be on a blood thinner stop taking it in a year for a variety of reasons,” including cost or bleeding, said Wazni. The Watchman implant closes the LAA to prevent clots from escaping and blocking blood flow to the brain. The study of 1,600 patients, called Option, showed the Watchman FLX device was non-inferior to oral anticoagulation, meeting its primary efficacy endpoint of death, stroke or embolism at three years. The rate of those events was 5.3% in the device group vs. 5.8% in the oral anticoagulation group. “The event rate was lower in the investigation on the device arm than oral anticoagulation,” Wazni said.” So it gives us a lot of confidence that it is truly non-inferior to blood thinners and equivalent to blood thinners in reducing the risk of stroke.” The data also met the primary safety endpoint of non-procedural major bleeding or clinically relevant non-major bleeding. On that measure, the device demonstrated superiority to oral anticoagulation, at 8.5% vs. 18.1%. \"These positive primary outcomes mean that patients receiving the [Watchman] FLX device were able to eliminate long-term medication use while maintaining stroke protection,” Brad Sutton, chief medical officer for atrial fibrillation solutions at Boston Scientific, said in a statement Saturday. “With this data, we see potential to both expand the indication for the [Watchman] FLX platform and ultimately elevate it to become a frontline therapy for patients receiving cardiac ablation for atrial fibrillation to reduce their risk of stroke.\" BTIG analyst Marie Thibault noted that Boston Scientific expects to receive a label expansion from the Food and Drug Administration in the second half of 2025. “We believe these data support the use of Watchman to decrease the risk of long-term bleeding and manage the risk of stroke in post-ablation patients,” Thibault wrote in a note to clients Sunday. In addition to the Option trial, Watchman is being evaluated against direct oral anticoagulants as a first-line therapy in lower-risk patients in the Champion-AF trial, Boston Scientific said.

Competition in the fast-growing pulsed field ablation (PFA) market has intensified with the arrival of Johnson & Johnson’s Varipulse system and new heart mapping capabilities from Boston Scientific and Medtronic. J&J’s U.S. approval this month created a three-way race among the medtech heavyweights for PFA devices to treat atrial fibrillation (AFib), an abnormal heart rhythm. Each now also has integrated mapping for doctors to track the heart’s electrical activity during the procedure. A person with AFib may feel their heart quivering, pounding or skipping beats. The condition increases the risk of blood clots and stroke. Doctors are embracing PFA\\xa0to treat AFib amid evidence the approach can restore normal heart rhythm with fewer complications than traditional methods of cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation. PFA, which delivers electrical pulses to destroy the cardiac cells causing AFib, also enables faster procedure times. Less than a year after its U.S. debut, PFA “is quickly becoming the standard of care,” J.P. Morgan analysts wrote last month. PFA is already the preferred form of treatment in about a quarter of AFib ablation procedures, at the expense of cryoablation and radiofrequency energy, according to Stifel analysts. J&J, Boston Scientific and Abbott executives described a changing AFib treatment landscape on their third-quarter earnings calls. On Tuesday, Medtronic is expected to weigh in on early progress launching its second-generation PFA device, Affera, when it reports quarterly results. Here is where medtech companies stand in the rapidly evolving PFA market: In October, Boston Scientific unveiled Farawave Nav, a follow-up to its Farapulse system and the first mapping-integrated PFA catheter to hit the U.S. market. Farapulse launched in January, a month after Medtronic’s Pulseselect. Both companies have seen strong adoption for their initial offerings. Truist Securities in October predicted that by 2026, PFA would comprise about 60% of a global AFib market worth $8.2 billion, with Boston Scientific claiming at least half the share. Farapulse is driving a “transformative conversion” from radiofrequency and cryoablation thanks to excellent outcomes for patients and efficiencies for providers, Boston Scientific CEO Mike Mahoney said on an October earnings call. Strong procedure volumes helped the company’s electrophysiology sales nearly triple in the third quarter. Farapulse is approved for people who have episodes of AFib that come and go, called paroxysmal AFib, and don’t respond well to medications. Boston Scientific has its sights on additional patient groups as well. One clinical trial underway is studying Farapulse in drug-refractory patients with persistent AFib lasting more than a week. Mahoney expects a label expansion for the indication in the second half of 2025. Boston Scientific is also evaluating the system as a first-line treatment for persistent AFib. Days after Boston Scientific won the nod for Farapulse Nav, Medtronic announced Food and Drug Administration authorization for its second PFA device, the Affera mapping and ablation system. Affera is indicated for persistent AFib and is the first catheter to combine mapping and a dual-energy option that allows physicians to switch between PFA and radiofrequency. Needham analysts called Affera a “considerably more formidable threat to Farapulse” and predicted the device would capture more market share than Medtronic’s Pulseselect system, which is approved to treat both paroxysmal and persistent AFib in drug-refractory patients. Medtronic has also begun to study Affera in patients with ventricular tachycardia, a form of arrhythmia that causes the heart to beat abnormally fast. J&J is now set to challenge Medtronic and Boston Scientific in the U.S. after getting the FDA’s go-ahead for Varipulse in drug-refractory, paroxysmal patients. The platform integrates with J&J’s Carto mapping system in a single device. Mapping integration could give J&J an edge, according to J.P. Morgan’s analysts, because many hospitals already have a Carto system. “J&J’s large existing presence in PFA could help drive share when it comes to market, especially in cases where mapping is needed,” the analysts said. More than half of competitors’ cases use J&J mapping, said J&J Medtech Chairman Tim Schmid, adding that the company’s $5 billion electrophysiology business is the sector leader. “That combination of the 5,500 installed base of Carto system\\'s best-in-class mapping and highly trained mappers, we believe, is a significant advantage and positions us extremely well when PFA comes to market,” Schmid said on an October call. Beyond Varipulse, J&J expects to develop a range of PFA catheters and has already applied for the CE mark in Europe for a dual-energy device, said Schmid. Abbott, which does not yet have a PFA system on the market, expects to file for FDA approval next year for its Volt device, CEO Robert Ford said on an October call. \"We\\'re very committed to being able to bring PFA to the market,” Ford said. Abbott also said last month it completed enrollment in its Volt U.S. clinical trial ahead of schedule. Enrollment in the Volt CE mark study was completed earlier this year. Like J&J, Abbott already has a large installed base of mapping systems that the company expects will bolster the appeal of its PFA option. With open cardiac mapping, Abbott’s electrophysiology business has benefited from the rollout of other PFA systems as procedure volumes rise, Ford said. Still, Abbott’s electrophysiology growth has been shy of the market overall, the CEO noted. Abbott has maintained that existing PFA technologies have limitations and is betting on a new device design, called “balloon in basket,” to improve the procedure. In addition to Volt, Abbott is developing a device that can deliver both PFA and radiofrequency energy. Recommended Reading J&J wins FDA approval for Varipulse PFA system'}\n",

The company recently held the Llama Impact Hackathon in London. The event brought together over 200 developers across 56 teams that used Meta’s open source Llama 3.2 model to address critical challenges in healthcare, clean energy, and social mobility. Per the company, the winning team, Guardian, developed a concept of an AI-powered triage assistant which could reduce waiting times and better allocate resources in accident and emergency departments. Overall, META ranks 3rd on our list of AI stocks to watch according to latest news and ratings.

Nvidia responded at the time saying that design iterations are normal and expected. The report followed a separate Blackwell design issue that Nvidia addressed over the summer, which gave Wall Street pause about whether the chip would land on customers' doorsteps on time. Now Nvidia is saying that the chips aren’t just shipping, they’re in the hands of all of the company’s major partners as well. In Q3, Nvidia reported that cloud service providers, companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL), made up 50% of the chipmaker’s data center revenue. Ensuring they’re getting Blackwell chips sooner than later is paramount for Nvidia’s continued growth. And the company appears to be doing just that. Read more: Nvidia nearly triples in value over 11 months: Is it time to invest? “With any product ramp, there's always a great deal of complexity, and Blackwell is no different,” Dan Flax, senior research analyst and managing director at Neuberger Berman, told Yahoo Finance. “And I think what's notable is that Nvidia and its partners are executing well. I think supply will improve over the next couple of months as they really scale Blackwell.” But there’s one problem that continues to bedevil Nvidia: supply constraints. The sheer number of companies jockeying for position to grab the AI behemoth’s chips makes it difficult to meet demand. “It is the case that demand exceeds supply,” Huang told analysts. “And that’s expected as we’re in the beginning of this generative AI revolution.” For some perspective, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors during the company’s most recent earnings call that the social media giant is training its Llama 4 AI models on a server cluster made up of more than 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips. The H100 is Nvidia’s prior-generation Hopper AI accelerator. With Blackwell promising far better performance than Hopper, it only makes sense that massive AI companies like Meta (META) are angling to get as many of those chips as possible. As Blackwell production continues to ramp, though, the company should be able to ensure its most important customers get the chips they need. “Nvidia's supply chain and all the data center power capacity is increasing at a very rapid pace,” New Street Research technology infrastructure analyst Antoine Chkaiban told Yahoo Finance in a video interview. “And so here the conclusion is that there is no bottleneck preventing Nvidia from ... meeting consensus expectations next year.” In its Wednesday earnings announcement, Nvidia reported better-than-anticipated results on the top and bottom lines, beating Wall Street’s estimates and modestly topping the outlook for its current quarter. Revenue jumped 94% year over year, while Data Center sales climbed 112%. Despite that, shares fell in early trading Thursday. This isn’t the first time the market has turned on Nvidia after it posted huge revenue growth. Investors pulled back after the company’s last earnings report as well before rallying behind the stock in the following weeks and making Nvidia the largest publicly traded company in the world ahead of Apple earlier this month.

(NASDAQ:META) stands against the other AI stocks that are dominating headlines. AI stocks are soaring and AI startups are receiving billions in funding from venture capital firms as the new technology sweeps investors off their feet. However, as the AI boom plays out, the central bank in Europe has issued a dire warning about the development of an AI bubble. The warning was included in the biannual Financial Stability Review, a report that lists the risks that could threaten the financial well being of world markets. In the review, the European Central Bank noted that the stock market, particularly in the United States, had become increasingly dependent on a handful of companies perceived as the beneficiaries of the AI boom. Read more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs. Per the ECB, this concentration among a few large firms raises concerns over the possibility of an AI-related asset price bubble. It added that in a context of deeply integrated global equity markets, it points to the risk of adverse global spillovers, should earnings expectations for these firms be disappointing. The ECB further underlined that investors were demanding a low premium to own shares and bonds while funds had cut their cash buffers. Given relatively low liquid asset holdings and significant liquidity mismatches in some types of open-ended investment funds, cash shortages could result in forced asset sales that could amplify downward asset price adjustments, the ECB said.

Often, fund managers reposition their portfolios in December, which can lead to what\\'s called a \"Santa Claus Rally.\" This effect causes stock prices to rise significantly in December because a lot of people are buying. Three stocks that see heavy buying interest in December are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ: ASML). Each company is well-positioned for the long term yet has short-term reasons why it\\'s a good buy. Start Your Mornings Smarter!\\xa0Wake up with Breakfast news in your inbox every market day.\\xa0Sign Up For Free » Alphabet is better known as Google\\'s parent company but also has other strong areas under its umbrella. It\\'s deeply involved in the generative AI arms race through its Gemini model, which has emerged as a top model to use in this space. Part of this strength comes from its cloud computing division, Google Cloud. Google Cloud allows clients to rent computing space so they can easily scale up or down. It also gives them access to industry-leading graphics processing units (GPUs) and AI accelerators to train their AI models quickly. This division has been on fire lately, with revenue rising 35% last quarter. Altogether, Alphabet is executing at a very high level, yet its stock price doesn\\'t reflect that fact. The stock trades for a mere 21.5 times forward earnings, which is a huge discount from other tech peers like Microsoft and Apple, which trade at a respective 31.7 and 30.4 times forward earnings. Furthermore, Alphabet is growing its earnings much faster than these two, so this undervaluation makes no sense. To add even more fuel to the fire, Alphabet trades at a lower price than the S&P 500, which trades at 24.6 times forward earnings. Alphabet is a great company that\\'s trading at a huge discount, and I expect both fund managers and investors to take advantage of this price shortly. I could nearly copy and paste the Alphabet paragraph onto the Meta Platforms portion and have most of the same be true. Instead of search engine dominance, though, Meta has social media dominance. The company derives a massive chunk of revenue through its Facebook, Instagram, and other platforms through advertising. Meta also has generative AI aspirations through its Llama model, which has also become a top choice for anyone developing a model powered by generative AI. Meta is also executing at a very high level, with revenue rising 19% year over year and diluted earnings per share (EPS) increasing 37%. These are very high levels, considering Meta\\'s size, and show the company\\'s strength. One area where it differs from Alphabet is its price tag, as it trades at 24.5 times forward earnings. This is essentially the same price as the S&P 500, but considering how quickly Meta is growing earnings and revenue, it\\'s a cheap stock price. Meta Platforms could see a further run-up before the end of the year. I think it also makes a great long-term investment. ASML is quite a bit different than Alphabet and Meta. It doesn\\'t have to do any advertising and is the only company in the world that can build its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines. Semiconductor companies use these machines to put traces on chips at microscopic levels. Without ASML\\'s technology, there wouldn\\'t be the same computing capabilities there are today, putting AI advancements on hold. As ASML is the only company in the world with these capabilities, its machines are highly regulated, and a growing number of them are increasingly outlawed from being sold to China and its allies. This is a problem because China made up nearly 50% of sales in the third quarter. However, this was an outsized portion, compared to historical averages, and management expects its China revenue share to come down to around 20% in 2025. This decrease also affected ASML\\'s 2025 revenue outlook as it decreased the range from 30 billion to 40 billion euros down to 30 billion to 35 billion euros. Investors didn\\'t like that news and sent the stock tumbling following the release. However, management was clear that the long-term growth picture was still intact and that this was just a bump in the road. The damage to the stock has been done, and it now trades at 33 times forward earnings. While that may be expensive compared to the other two, it\\'s the cheapest that ASML\\'s stock has been in a long time. Furthermore, ASML has no competition in this space. While the short-term may be a bit bumpy, the long-term trend of consumers using more chips and more powerful chips is undeniable. As a result, ASML is a fantastic buy before 2025.
